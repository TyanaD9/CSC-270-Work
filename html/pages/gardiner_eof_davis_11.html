<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">x.3</span><span class="cts_passage">"All the world's a stage,  And all the men and women merely players,  They have their exits and their entrances,  And one man in his time plays many parts."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">x.4</span><span class="cts_passage">Garrick was one of the first of our English actors to realize how much  the success of a piece depended upon appropriate costume, and, on his  taking the management of Drury Lane Theatre in 1747, at once turned his  attention to this important branch of dramatic art. He refused to  tolerate the absurdity of a heterogeneous mixture of the foreign and  ancient modes, which had hitherto debased tragedies by representing, for  instance, Greek soldiers in full-bottomed wigs, and the King of an  Oriental Nation in trunk hose. The improvement, however, must have been  very gradual, for Garrick is said to have played the part of Macbeth ten  years later in a gold-laced suit of sky blue and scarlet; while Mrs.  Yates as Lady Macbeth appeared in a hooped court petticoat of enormous  dimensions, with tight-fitting pointed bodice and elbow sleeves, and her  powdered hair dressed over a high cushion. Garrick's suits for the  characters of King Lear and Hamlet also followed the fashions of the  18th century, though he played Richard III. in a fancy dress designed  with some regard to correctness of detail. Even during the present  century, an equally absurd anachronism may be recorded. The late Mr.  Charles Mathews made his first appearance in public, at the Theatre  Royal, Richmond, as Richmond in Richard III., wearing the helmet and  jacket of a modern light horse soldier.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">x.6</span><span class="cts_passage">The first pantomime or harlequinade was played in England in 1717, and  the earliest illustration of an English harlequin in the dress now  familiar to us, is to be found in a sketch of Bartholomew Fair, dated  1721. Of the characters of columbine, pantaloon, and clown, we have no  contemporary drawings. Of the French ballet dancers of this period there  are some carefully-executed plates in Planche's "CyclopAedia of Costume."  They are all represented in long, and sometimes in trained skirts. The  first example of the abbreviated ballet skirt, reaching to the knee, is  given in the portrait of an actress personating Le Zephyr, about the  middle of the 18th century. The peasant costume of various nations has  also been adapted to stage purposes with excellent effect.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">x.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The late Hon. Lewis Wingfield devoted much time to designing the stage  dresses of the Victorian era, and Madame Alias--who has also passed  away--provided the costumes in Mr. Calvert's revival of Henry VIII., and  was also responsible for dressing many of the Alhambra ballets and the  plays at London and provincial theatres. Madame Bernhardt, Miss Ellen  Terry, Mrs. Langtry, Sir Henry Irving, and the late Sir Augustus Harris  have also brought their influence, money, and taste to bear on correct  stage costume, with the result that we have had many sumptuously-dressed  revivals and new plays, which otherwise might have sunk into oblivion.  Such spectacles as are often to be seen at our leading Metropolitan  theatres and music halls, if they fail to touch the public fancy, mean  absolute and irretrievable ruin to their promoters; and when it is  remembered that many thousands are spent annually in staging theatrical  enterprises, before a single seat is booked, it will at once be seen  what enormous sums must be involved in furthering dramatic interests.  The public, who have for the last sixty years been catered for so  generously, are sometimes apt to overlook the difficulties with which  the scenic artist has to contend.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">x.8</span><span class="cts_passage">It would be impossible within the circumscribed limit of a single volume  to minutely describe even the most notable theatrical costumes of the  last half century, but a few of the most effective floral costumes will  be appended for the benefit of those who desire to introduce them into  various entertainments.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">x.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The steady patronage of Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Family have  done much to remove any prejudices which existed against the drama, and  as a powerful auxiliary to education the stage is rapidly gaining  ground. Dull, indeed, must the theatre-goer be if he leaves without  having assimilated some valuable lesson. To Shakespeare we owe many  ideal types of womanhood, all the more precious now that some of the  weaker sex, in an insatiable desire for progress, sometimes neglect  those lesser arts which in the past proved to them a shield and buckler.  The classical and historical pieces allow us to live again in scenes  which occurred when the world was young, and convince us, though the  tastes of the people were simpler, human nature, with its passions and  aspirations, has changed but little. Who can deny the moral influence of  such plays as "The Sign of the Cross," "Hypatia," "The Daughters of  Babylon," "Virginius," or those of the Robertson school, of which  "Caste" and "Ours" are examples? A love of music is not considered a  marked trait of the English nation, yet have not Italian and comic opera  stimulated a desire for a concord of sweet sounds among all classes of  the community? Such plays as "Patience" and the "Mikado" have developed  our instinct for colour and form, and we are taught the value of  industry and restraint when we watch well-trained actors, capable of  controlling every gesture, and of charming us with their well-modulated  voices. Our lives are cheered by viewing the comic side of things, and  on our clothing and household possessions, the stage has also laid a  refining hand.</span></div>
