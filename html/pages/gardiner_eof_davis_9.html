<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.4</span><span class="cts_passage">Of children's dress in olden times we have singularly few details, and,  as a rule, it may be concluded that their raiment was fashioned on  similar lines to that worn by the men and women of the country in which  they lived, and was more or less ornamented, according to their station  in life.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.6</span><span class="cts_passage">One or two biblical references enlighten us as to Eastern customs. On  the authority of St. Luke, our Saviour in infancy was wrapped in  swaddling clothes. "Samuel," we are told, "being a child, was girded  with a linen ephod," which appears to have been a close robe or vest  reaching from the shoulders to the loins, and confined by a girdle.  Considering the climate and the habits of the people, it was probably  the only garment used in summer, but in cold weather was supplemented,  we presume, by the little coat his mother bought him from year to year,  when she and her husband came to offer the annual sacrifice, at Shiloh,  where Eli, the High Priest, lived. A coat of many colours was also  presented to Joseph in his youth as a mark of Jacob's affection for the  child of his old age.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.7</span><span class="cts_passage">Greek and Roman children of the gentler sex are usually represented in  the chiton, or loose classical gown, combined with a shawl or himation  weighted at the four corners, so as to assist the wearer in adjusting  it. How to put on this garment was carefully taught as part of a girl's  education. The long end was first thrown over the left shoulder. The  front part was arranged in folds across the body, passed under the right  arm and over the left shoulder or forearm. The girdle sometimes  consisted of a cord, at others of metal bands, and by drawing the chiton  over it, a double thickness of the fabric covered the vital organs of  the body. Boys wore the tunic and toga, and the latter is supposed to  have been oblong, with the corners rounded off, so as to give a  semicircular effect. Hats were not commonly worn, except by the poor or  when on a journey, a fold of the toga or mantle serving for a head  covering, and sandals protected the feet.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.8</span><span class="cts_passage">The Egyptian labouring classes allowed their children to be nude, and  infants were unfamiliar with swaddling clothes. The working man and boy  had simply a loin cloth and girdle, and the girl a loose tunic fastened  with strings at the neck and reaching to her feet. On the other hand,  children of the upper classes in Egypt were repetitions of their elders  on a small scale. Girls wore a linen skirt embroidered in colours and  fastened with a bright sash, or suspended from the shoulders, and over  this a loose transparent robe with long sleeves. The male costume  consisted of a loin cloth, and a full robe with short sleeves, or a  tunic, and both sexes had elaborately curled or plaited wigs, as the  natural hair was only allowed to grow in times of mourning.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The Roman occupation of Britain left its impress for a long period on  the costume of the Anglo-Saxon race. The long-sleeved banded tunic was  the usual habit of the industrial classes through the Middle Ages and  leg bandages and cross gartering preceded breeches. Quite young boys  appear in this dress, and little girls are seen in ancient MSS. in the  kirtle and gunna, the equivalents of the modern petticoat and dress.  Their hair, however, was allowed to fall naturally, or was dressed with  two pendant plaits, and was not concealed, as was so often the case with  adult females, by means of the head-rail. The materials used in clothing  were to a great extent the produce of household industry. The women  servants were employed in spinning, weaving, and sewing, and ladies of  the highest rank did not disdain to participate in such labours. Several  articles of dress were derived from the tanner, who worked up his  leather into shoes, ankle leathers, and leathern hose. The art of  tanning skins with the wool or hair on, was also practised, and dyeing  was in great request, for in a rude age a love of gaudy colours is a  natural characteristic of the people. The most skilful artificers were  found in the religious houses, but under each landowner serfs were  trained in the mechanical arts. Silk was worn by the wealthy, but the  common materials for wearing apparel in this country were cotton, linen,  and woollen.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Among the Anglo-Saxons and their pagan ancestors the desertion of  children sometimes occurred, but as the influence of Christianity  increased, it was regarded as a crime, and a law was passed for its  repression. For fostering a foundling the State allowed 6s. the first  year; 12s. the second; and 30s. for the third year; and afterward the  foster parent was to receive a sum varying according to the appearance  of the child. Children bereft of their father, remained under the  mother's care, but until the eldest child became of age were subject to  the guardianship of the husband's relations. Mothers usually nursed  their own children, cradles were used, and for the first few months  their clothing was swathed with a bandage. In this compact form they  were more easily carried, though the constraint to which they were  subjected, probably prevented that free development of the limbs, which  we now consider so essential to health and beauty. If very poor, the  father was allowed to sell his son into slavery for seven years,  providing the consent of the child was obtained, and one ten years old  could give evidence. Until a daughter was fifteen years of age, her  father could marry her as he pleased, but afterwards had no power to do  so. A boy of fifteen could enter the monastic life if so disposed, and a  girl at a somewhat later period. Monasteries offered the best education  then procurable, and the clergy were directed to "teach youth with care,  and to draw them to some craft." Schoolboys appear to have been kept in  order, by the dread of personal chastisement, and great respect and  reverence was exacted by their elders.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.13</span><span class="cts_passage">In the dress of the Blue-coat School (Christ's Hospital), we see the  ordinary costume of boys of the Tudor period. It consisted of a long  coat reaching to the heels and knee-breeches, a striped vest, yellow  stockings, and a small round cap placed on the side of the head. The  dress of little girls may be found on various monumental effigies, in  which they appear like their mothers, in full skirts, sometimes  distended by a fardingale, the body imprisoned in whalebone to the hips,  a folded ruff encircling the neck, and their stockings (according to  Stubbs) were of the finest yarn, silk, thread, or cloth that could  possibly be had, of changeable colours, cunningly knit, with curiously  indented points, clocks, and open seams. The shoes were of black, green,  white and yellow velvet, or of leather stitched with silk and  embroidered with gold and silver all over the foot.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.15</span><span class="cts_passage">The paintings of Vandyck bring graphically before us the picturesque  elements of the dress of the Stuart era. There is an air of richness and  refinement about the long skirted silken frocks embellished with lace,  the pointed collars, and beaver hats with trailing feathers universally  worn, and the quaint lace caps, which, by a turn of fashion's wheel,  have been remodelled for the children of today.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.16</span><span class="cts_passage">[Illustration]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.17</span><span class="cts_passage">At no period in the history of costume were the styles so offensive to  those with a true conception of colour and form than in the first half  of the nineteenth century. We have only to turn to the sketches of Leech  and contemporary artists to find bare necks and arms, conspicuous  underwear, very short skirts distended by a stiffened petticoat or  crinoline, white cotton stockings, low shoes fastened by a strap and  single button, mushroom hats, aprons and pinafores devoid of elegance  and grace, and the hair cut close to the head or arranged in rows of  stiff ringlets. Nor did the boys of England, in trousers buttoned high  on short jackets, or with tunics worn with frilled linen collars and  leathern belts, show to greater advantage. Queen Victoria inaugurated a  new system of clothing for boys, when she dressed the young Princes in  Scotch and sailor suits, and the wardrobes of all classes have been  considerably extended of late, by the open-air life and outdoor sports  in which every self-respecting lad indulges. Cricket, tennis, boating,  football, and cycling, all imperatively demand appropriate apparel, and  tailors now give reasonable attention to this important branch of their  business, and provide fabrics and designs suited to the needs of the  rising generation.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i073b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Habits of personal cleanliness and the influence of dress on the minds  of growing girls is hardly realized except by those directly concerned  in education. Many a sensitive child's character has been warped by the  thoughtless jeers of schoolfellows, who were quick to perceive that her  clothing was not up-to-date or of such good material as their own. On  the other hand, vanity, envy, and uncharitableness have been engendered  by foolish mothers, who have provided their daughters with inappropriate  and extravagant outfits.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i074.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Though many advocate uniforms with distinctive trimmings for girls'  colleges, there are drawbacks to the scheme being adopted. Such a course  would probably destroy the individuality which we all desire to see  applied to the choice of clothing, and it would leave no field for  original ideas. Children must be _trained_ to select and wear their  clothes to the best advantage, and it is folly to think that they will  do so by intuition. Some may possess naturally an artistic sense and a  keen eye for colour, but they are certainly in the minority, and  rational dress reformers have pushed sensible ideas to the verge of  absurdity, till now the name is almost regarded as a term of reproach.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.23</span><span class="cts_passage">[Illustration]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">viii.24</span><span class="cts_passage">How much we owe to pioneers of children's dress reform, and especially  to Messrs. Liberty, who evolved what is generally known as the Aesthetic  style in dress. From sketches courteously placed at my disposal, I am  enabled to put before the reader examples of children's clothing which  are artistic in form, light of texture, and which in no way impede the  physical development. Those who have the care of children should  remember what a sacred charge is imposed upon them, and that their  future health mainly depends, upon the manner in which they are clothed  during the first few years of life. There must be no tight bands, belts,  or garters to prevent circulation and to cause organic troubles; and  where corsets are dispensed with, as happily they are in many cases  where growing girls are concerned, the weight of the clothing should be  borne by the shoulders, not the waist, and this is ensured by cutting  undergarments in the princess or combination forms. Many young people  suffer from being carelessly shod, and hideous malformations of the feet  arise in consequence, while obscure diseases of the brain can sometimes  be traced to heavy head-gear, and the strain of over-study. Hats should  be of light construction, and afford a grateful shade to the eyes, if  that far-reaching ailment of civilisation, short sight, is to be  successfully combatted; and special attention must be paid to infants,  who may often be seen in public thoroughfares with a hot sun beating  down upon them, and the nurse oblivious to the fact. The sight of a  tender infant entrusted to the care of a young woman, who has not the  glimmering of a notion of how to look after its fragile body, must fill  any right-minded person with indignation. Is it unreasonable to expect  those who undertake the charge of children to acquaint themselves with  at least an elementary knowledge of the construction and functions of  the human body? The ignorance of the average nursemaid is appalling;  and though a board school education may have acquainted her with the  mysteries of the First Book of Euclid, or the rudiments of music, the  curriculum rarely includes the simplest instruction on the healthy  training of children; and, in consequence, the high rate of infant  mortality in this country is a national disgrace.</span></div>
