<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.2</span><span class="cts_passage">FANCY COSTUME OF VARIOUS PERIODS.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.3</span><span class="cts_passage">"The dome, where pleasure holds her midnight reign,  Here richly decked, admits the gorgeous train;  Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,  The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.4</span><span class="cts_passage">During the Roman occupation of Britain, many sports and pastimes, with  their appropriate costumes, were introduced into this country from  Southern Europe and the East, and at a very early period mummings were  popular with the people. These were primitive masquerades, where the  actors, if we may judge from antique illuminations, generally mimicked  the brute creation rather than human beings. They often appeared between  the courses at banquets, and on important occasions elaborate pageants  were arranged. Ships filled with mariners were sometimes introduced, or  towers garrisoned with armed men, while the actors portrayed some  allegorical lesson or historical incident.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.5</span><span class="cts_passage">A well-known event intimately connected with masking was the narrow  escape from death by fire of Charles VI. of France, on January 29th,  1392. The king, with eleven of his knights, for the amusement of the  Court, dressed like savages, in tight-fitting garments of linen covered  with flax, and were dancing before the Queen and the Duchess de Berri,  when the Duc d'Orleans with a torch accidentally ignited the inflammable  costume of a masker, who was chained to four others. The Duchess  protected the King by wrapping him in the train of her mantle, but four  persons died in great agony.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Edward III. issued an ordinance against vagrants who exhibited  scandalous masquerades in low ale-houses, and directed that such persons  should be whipped out of London. The Feast of Fools was one of the most  singular of these exhibitions. It somewhat resembled the Roman  Saturnalia, and was enacted at Christmas. In England the celebration of  this festival does not appear to have been attended with the same  excesses as were commonly practised on the Continent, but it was  nevertheless a season of licence, in which order and discipline were  reversed. The churl was elected to represent the Pope; the buffoon was  made a cardinal; and the lowest of the mob assumed for the time being  the garb of the priesthood, and took possession of churches, where they  parodied every part of the sacred service, and sang masses composed of  obscene songs.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.7</span><span class="cts_passage">Dramatic representations were so tainted by the grossness and  licentiousness of the age, that priests were prohibited from attending  them, till the Church introduced religious plays, founded on scriptural  incidents, and which were known as miracles and mysteries. For these the  actors were trained by the clergy, and sacred edifices and vestments  were placed at their disposal, to give truth and lustre to the  representations.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.8</span><span class="cts_passage">There were frequent tournaments after the Norman Invasion, and these  were patronized and encouraged by Richard C[oe]ur de Lion. From this era  they occupied a prominent place in the national institutions and  history, and afforded many opportunities for the display of picturesque  costume. Ladies on these occasions were conspicuous, and sometimes rode  in parti-coloured tunics with short hoods and tippets wrapped about  their heads. Their girdles were decorated with gold and silver, and they  carried small swords. The space marked out for the combat was surrounded  by raised seats for high-born dames, princes, and the judges of the  conflict. Knights wore their ladies' colours on their helmets,  emblazoned on their clothing, and on the trappings of their horses; and  throngs of troubadours, heralds, and minstrels dressed in gorgeous  attire, were present to discharge their duties, and to give importance  to the spectacle.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.9</span><span class="cts_passage">The ancient English Morris Dance, performed with other quaint usages on  the 1st of May, is supposed to be of Moorish origin. It is depicted on  an antique stained glass window at Betley, in Staffordshire. The  May-pole and the Man with the Hobby Horse (who represents a Moorish  King, and is the consort of the May Queen), occupy a prominent position.  The other characters are the Fool, the Lesser Fool, Tom the Piper, a  Spaniard, the Franklin or private gentleman, a Churl or peasant, the May  Queen, a Nobleman, and a Friar. The dresses were adorned with bells,  intended to sound the measure of the dancers. They were of different  sizes, and were called the fore bell, the second bell, the treble, the  tenor, and the great bell.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Planche, in his valuable work, the "CyclopAedia of Costume," states the  earliest illustration of a _bal costume_ is in a MS. of the fifteenth  century, in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, and he gives a reproduction  from an old painting on wood dating from 1463, representing a dance by  torchlight at the Court of Burgundy. Each person holds a long lighted  taper, and this dance, up to the sixteenth century, was usually reserved  for wedding festivities. In England masked balls were rare before the  reign of William III., and in France they first took place during the  regency of Philip, Duke of Orleans, when the Opera House was converted  into a ball-room. Father Sebastian, a Carmelite friar, devised a means  of elevating the floor of the pit to the level of the stage, and of  lowering it at pleasure.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Ranelagh and Vauxhall Gardens, and Belsize House, Hampstead, were also  places of popular resort, and scenes of many entertainments during the  eighteenth century. There were pyrotechnic displays, bands of music,  frequent balls, and facilities for dinner and supper parties. The lawns  were dotted with arbours, lakes, and artificial cascades; the trees were  festooned with coloured lamps, and the costumes of those who frequented  these gatherings were elaborate and costly.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.12</span><span class="cts_passage">From the writings of Horace Walpole and others, we learn that private  open-air galas were of common occurrence among the aristocracy, and he  gives a description of a _festino_ at Northumberland House in honour of  the Marquess of Tavistock and his bride; when arches and pyramids of  lights alternately surrounded the enclosure, and festoons of lamps edged  the railings. In 1761 Her Majesty Queen Charlotte surprised her husband  on his birthday with a splendid garden party, followed by fireworks, a  cold supper of a hundred dishes, and an illuminated dessert. The Duke of  Richmond celebrated a similar occasion with a masked ball and music--the  vocal parts performed by many of the nobility, in fancy dress. Here,  too, there was a display of fireworks in the garden and from the river.  Almack's new Subscription and Assembly Room was opened in February,  1765, under distinguished patronage; and Gibbon mentions a masquerade at  a rival establishment, the Pantheon, which he states was above par in  magnificence, and below par in humour, and cost E5000.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Five o'clock was the dinner hour of fashionable people during the  eighteenth century, and three for those of lower rank. At eleven p.m.  supper was usually served, and breakfast was from nine to eleven a.m.  The House of Commons commenced sitting at two, and the Opera began at  seven.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.14</span><span class="cts_passage">At this period the domino (evolved from the priestly cowl) was in great  request, and was used in the boxes of theatres for purposes of  concealment, and by those of questionable morals. Though the large hoop  towards the close of the eighteenth century was only worn at Court, or  in full dress, the pocket hoop for distending the panniers was still in  vogue. For the abolition of the Court hoop, we are indebted to George  IV., whose taste in dress was unimpeachable. Powder and patches  maintained their ground till 1793, when they were discarded by Queen  Charlotte and the Princesses. Aprons were regarded as a necessary item  of a fashionable costume up to 1750, and the watch and etui adorned the  waist, necklaces sparkled on the bosom, and bracelets were worn over  long gloves.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.15</span><span class="cts_passage">The French Revolution affected masculine costume; and in 1789 were  introduced into this country the muslin cravat, in which the chin was  partially concealed, stand-up collars, Hessian boots, and round hats of  beaver. Scarlet coats were much in vogue about 1784, and an anecdote in  "The Life of Sir Astley Cooper" represents him as returning from a  dancing academy in a scarlet coat, a three-cocked hat, a black glazed  stock, nankeen knee-breeches, and silk stockings. This may be regarded  as the ordinary costume of a gentleman at that period.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.16</span><span class="cts_passage">Wigs had begun to go out of fashion as early as 1763, in which year the  wigmakers petitioned King George III. to support the trade by his  example. "The hair," says Malcolm, "was dressed high on the head,  whitened with powder, and alternately plaited and turned up or queued  behind." When the hair powder tax--one guinea per annum--was enforced in  1795, thousands of heads reverted to their natural colour.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Some brilliant fancy dress balls (with a view to encouraging home trade)  have taken place during the Victorian era. Of the first, which was given  by the Queen and Prince Consort at Buckingham Palace in 1842, a  permanent memorial exists in two handsome volumes compiled by J. R.  Planche, containing carefully coloured illustrations of the various  dresses, and autograph portraits of the wearers. They form an invaluable  book of reference for those desiring accurate representations of the  costume of the period of Edward III. (1327-1377). A special feature of  this ball was a series of costume quadrilles, arranged by ladies of the  Court and others of high rank. They were danced in the following  order:--</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.18</span><span class="cts_passage">French quadrille, led by H. R. H. the Duchess of Cambridge.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Spanish quadrille, led by the Duchess of Buccleuch.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.20</span><span class="cts_passage">German quadrille, led by the Duchess of Sutherland.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Crusaders' quadrille, led by the Marchioness of Londonderry.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Waverley quadrille, led by the Countess de la Warr.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.23</span><span class="cts_passage">Scotch quadrille, led by the Duchess of Buccleuch.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Cossack quadrille, led by Baroness Bremon.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.25</span><span class="cts_passage">Greek quadrille, led by the Duchess of Leinster.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i081.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.27</span><span class="cts_passage">Prince Albert, as Edward III., wore a costume copied from the effigy of  that king in Westminster Abbey. It consisted of a long tunic of gold and  blue brocade, reaching to the ankles. The collar, which fitted close  round the neck, was bordered with purple velvet, thickly studded with  jewels. The tunic, which had an opening up the centre to the height of  the knee, was bordered and enriched with jewels to correspond with the  collar, as were the wristbands. The hose were scarlet, also the shoes,  which were embroidered with gold. Over the tunic, His Royal Highness  wore a mantle reaching to the heels, composed of the richest scarlet  velvet, bordered by a broad gold figured lace, set on each side with  large pearls. It was lined with ermine, and connected across the breast  by a band of purple velvet, studded with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds,  and in the centre was a turquoise of immense size and perfect colour.  The band was fastened to the mantle on either side by a massive gold  ornament enriched with precious stones.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i082.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.29</span><span class="cts_passage">Her Majesty the Queen as Philippa of Hainault, wife of Edward III., was  attired in a demi-trained skirt of crimson velvet, edged with miniver.  Over this was worn a surcoat of blue and gold brocade, trimmed with fur  to match, and embellished with a stomacher of jewels valued at E60,000.  The other portions of the costume were also studded with jewels. The  mantle was of gold brocade, with a floral design in silver. The hair was  encased in a gold net, enriched with precious stones, and was surmounted  by a crown.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.30</span><span class="cts_passage">Princess Augusta of Cambridge personated Princess Claude, daughter of  Anne of Bretagne, Queen of France. Her dress of silver tissue was  bordered with ermine, and the tunic was of light blue velvet, worked  with the fleur-de-lis in silver. The low bodice was bordered with  diamonds. The sleeves of silver tissue reached to the wrist, and were  trimmed with rows of pearls. The gloves were jewelled, and a white tulle  veil with silver embroideries depended from a turquoise and pearl  diadem. By Her Majesty's command, her own dress, that of Prince Consort,  and most of the costumes worn at this ball, were manufactured by the  silk-weavers of Spitalfields.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.31</span><span class="cts_passage">For the second royal ball in June, 1845, the period of George II.  (1727-1760) was selected, and 1200 guests were invited. The Queen looked  extremely well in powder, and her dress is described as of cloth of gold  and cloth of silver, with daisies and poppies worked in silk, and shaded  in natural colours. The trimmings and ruffles of exquisite point  lace--had belonged to Queen Charlotte--and the stomacher was trimmed  with lace and jewels. The sacque was ornamented with ribbons, caught  with diamonds. On the powdered coiffure was a diamond crown; Her  Majesty's white shoes had red rosettes with diamond centres, and she  wore the star and ribbon of the Order of the Garter. Prince Albert had a  costume of the same period, with the Star of the Garter, and the Order  of the Golden Fleece in brilliants. The Marchioness of Douro, the Duke  of Wellington's daughter-in-law, was the acknowledged belle of this  ball, and wore E60,000 worth of diamonds. Miss--now the  Baroness--Burdett Coutts was also present, her dress trimmed with jewels  once the property of Marie Antoinette.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.32</span><span class="cts_passage">In 1871 the Princess of Wales attended the Waverley Ball at Willis'  Rooms, with several other members of the Royal Family, and was much  admired in the character of the ill-fated Mary Stuart. On July 22nd,  1874, a fancy dress ball was given by their Royal Highnesses the Prince  and Princess of Wales at Marlborough House, for which some beautiful  costumes were prepared. The Princess wore a handsome Venetian dress, and  danced in the first quadrille with the present Duke of Devonshire. The  Prince in a Cavalier costume opened the ball with the late Duchess of  Sutherland. The chief costume quadrilles on this occasion were the  Venetian, the Vandyck, Characters in Fairy Tales, and a Pack of Cards.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Another historic _bal costume_ was given in February, 1895, at Warwick  Castle, by the Earl and Countess of Warwick. No more fitting background  for such a function can be imagined than this stately mansion, which has  been a centre of hospitality for countless generations, but has never  been presided over by no more gracious and popular chatelaine than the  present Countess. Lady Warwick looked very beautiful as Marie Antoinette  (the consort of Louis XVI. of France) in a petticoat and corsage of  exquisite English brocade, with a design of shaded roses, enriched with  gold thread on a pearl-coloured ground. The train of royal blue velvet,  embroidered in gold thread with the fleur-de-lis, was attached to the  shoulders by a band of diamonds; and the Warwick jewels, diamond stars,  were arranged on the corsage veiled with gold flecked gauze, which was  also employed for the puffed sleeves. Her elaborate white coiffure was  surmounted by a white muslin cap edged with blue velvet and adorned with  diamond aigrettes and plumes of pink, white, and blue feathers. Lady  Marjorie Greville (the only daughter of Lord and Lady Warwick) with Miss  Hamilton acted as train-bearers. They wore the daintiest white costumes  of the period, composed of broche silk, with fichus of white chiffon,  and silk hats trimmed with feathers. Each carried a long crook tied with  white ribbons and bunches of flowers, and the effect was charming. The  Earl of Warwick wore a French Court costume, the coat of ruby velvet  profusely trimmed with gold lace, white cloth cuffs, and revers. The  long white kerseymere waistcoat was braided in gold, and the white  knee-breeches and low shoes were ornamented with diamond buckles. The  Earl's wig, _a la mousquetaire_, was tied with a bow of black ribbon,  and he carried a tricorne hat with white ostrich plumes, and white  gauntlet gloves. Lady Warwick's two sisters, the Duchess of Sutherland  and Lady Angela Forbes, represented Marie Letzinka, consort of Louis  XV., and Lady Mary Campbell. The former wore a magnificent gown of white  satin de Lyon. The skirt embroidered with a flight of swallows in silver  and crystals, a deep bertha of Point de Flandre, with ruffles of the  same on the short sleeves. The train of crimson velvet was embroidered  with the French emblem, and Her Grace had a stomacher of splendid  diamonds. Lady Angela Forbes' dress was of white muslin, with a blue  sash, and picturesque hat of turquoise silk, trimmed with feathers and  roses. Princess Henry of Pless, as la Duchesse de Polignac, had a dress  of rich white satin, the skirt embroidered 18in. deep, with turquoises  and brilliants, a powdered wig, and the same jewels in her hair. Lady  Eva Dugdale, sister to the Earl of Warwick, and lady-in-waiting to Her  Royal Highness the Duchess of York, wore a Louis Quinze white satin  dress, covered with pink roses, corsage _en suite_ fastened with large  diamond ornaments. A silver trellis pattern was worked round the hem of  the skirt, and white silk mittens and shoes completed the costume. Lady  Rosslyn chose a white embroidered muslin petticoat, the overdress of  pink and red striped silk, fichu and ruches of black lisse, and a  picturesque hat. Lady Flo Sturt, as Madame la Marquise de Pompadour, was  in rich cream satin, with bodice and sleeves of antique lace, and  stomacher of diamonds. A black satin toque, with aigrette of diamonds,  contrasted well with the white wig. Count Deym, the Austrian Ambassador,  was in English Court dress. Prince Henry of Pless, in mousquetaire  costume, represented the Vicomte de Bragelonne. The Duke of Manchester  was in white satin breeches, waistcoat to match, bordered with gold, and  coat of white and silver brocade with moss roses and foliage.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.34</span><span class="cts_passage">The scene inside the Castle was one of unparalleled brilliancy, while  those who glanced from the mullioned windows saw by bright moonlight the  Avon frozen, the ancient cedars glistening with frost, and the  surrounding country wrapped in a snowy mantle. The entire ground floor  of the Castle was thrown open, and no pains were spared to give as  complete a representation as possible of the gorgeous fetes which made  the Court of Marie Antoinette famous throughout Europe. The finest  spectacle presented itself when the guests assembled at supper in the  oak-lined hall, where the light of a thousand candles was reflected in  the bright steel armour which surrounded the walls. Several high  screens, hung with Beauvais tapestry and shaded by huge palms, filled  the angles of the hall, and the stone walls were partially concealed by  yellow and silver embroideries. In the huge fireplace logs crackled, and  on small round tables were placed silver candelabra with crimson shades  and floral decorations, consisting of scarlet geraniums and maiden-hair  fern. The centre table was reserved for Marie Antoinette and her Court,  and here was the choicest display of family plate, including, amongst  other valuable specimens of the goldsmith's art, a golden cup modelled  by Benvenuto Cellini. From the hall you entered the Red Drawing room,  which contains a marble table, inlaid with flowers and fruit, and  formerly the property of Marie Antoinette. Next is the Cedar  Drawing-room, used as the ball-room, on whose walls are many family  portraits and other paintings by Vandyck; the remainder of the suite of  State apartments were used as withdrawing-rooms between the dances; and  at the opposite end of the Castle is the Library, the Billiard-room, and  the Countess's lovely Louis Seize Boudoir, in ivory tints, with festoons  of delicately-shaded flowers.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Dancing was carried on with great spirit till early morning, and the  tardy winter sun had risen ere the last carriage drove away from one of  the most successful balls of the nineteenth century.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.36</span><span class="cts_passage">Among the many important entertainments given by members of the English  aristocracy in honour of the sixtieth year of the reign of Queen  Victoria, was a Costume Ball at Devonshire House, Piccadilly, on July  2nd, 1897, when the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire received nearly all  the members of the Royal Family, many distinguished guests from the  Colonies, and members of the Corps Diplomatique. This historic mansion  was built for the third Duke of Devonshire, and it was here that  Georgiana, the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, held her Court. It  contains a fine suite of reception rooms on the first floor; a gallery  of pictures, in which the old masters are well represented; and  extensive grounds in the rear, which on this occasion were decorated  with thousands of Chinese lanterns and fairy lamps. The principal  feature of the ball was a grand procession of the guests, headed by the  Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, the former personating Charles V. of  Germany, and the latter attired with Oriental magnificence as Zenobia,  Queen of Palmyra, in a robe of silver tissue wrought with jewels. The  mantle was of cloth of gold similarly treated, and the bodice was also  studded with precious stones. The head-dress consisted of white ostrich  plumes and a golden and jewelled crown, from which depended chains of  pearls. H.R.H. the Princess of Wales, as Margaret of Valois, was  surrounded by the ladies of her Court, their Royal Highnesses Princess  Charles of Denmark, Princess Victoria of Wales, the Duchess of Fife, and  the Duchess of York. The Princess of Wales wore a gown of white satin  wrought with silver, and a train of cloth of gold lined with silver and  superbly jewelled. H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, as Grand Master of the  Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem and Chevalier of Malta,  wore a rich Elizabethan costume carried out in black and silver, and  bearing the white cross of the Order on one shoulder. The Duke of York  represented the Earl of Cumberland, one of Queen Elizabeth's courtiers.  Prince Charles of Denmark was a Danish student. The Duke of Connaught  wore the uniform of a military commander during the reign of Elizabeth,  and the Duchess looked charming as Queen Anne of Austria in a  picturesque gown with puffed sleeves. The Eastern Queens were  magnificently arrayed and blazing with jewels. Lady de Trafford was  Semiramis, Empress of Assyria, in a dress copied from a vase in the  British Museum. Princess Henry of Pless was Queen of Sheba, in a robe  and train of shot purple and gold tissue, elaborately embroidered with  turquoises and other stones, and wore an Assyrian jewelled head-dress,  decorated with a diamond bird and aigrette. Another Queen of Sheba was  Lady Cynthia Graham, and there were two Cleopatras--Lady de Grey and  Mrs. Arthur Paget. The husband of the latter accompanied her as Mark  Antony. Lady Elcho was a Byzantine Queen, Miss Muriel Wilson was Queen  Vashti, and the Countess of Dudley, as Queen Esther, wore a dress of  white crepe, embroidered with gold and studded with amethysts,  turquoises, and pearls.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ix.37</span><span class="cts_passage">The Elizabethan Court was represented by Lady Tweedmouth as Queen  Elizabeth, in a gown copied from a picture in the National Portrait  Gallery. Her canopy was carried by four yeomen in uniforms of crimson,  black, and gold, copied from Holbein's picture of "The Field of the  Cloth of Gold," in the Hampton Court collection. Lord Tweedmouth was the  Earl of Leicester, in slashed doublet and hose of ruby velvet and satin,  enriched with gold embroidery. Lady Edmondstone, as Mary Queen of Scots,  wore a dress of pale blue velvet, and tulle veil head-dress and ruff  worked with pearls. She was attended by the Duchess of Hamilton, dressed  in the character of Mary Hamilton, the Queen's favourite maid of honour.  The Countess of Warwick, as Marie Antoinette, was beautifully dressed in  a petticoat of rich white satin and a Court gown of English brocade,  with a train of Royal blue velvet. The hair was powdered, and she was  attended by four pages in white satin suits and three-cornered hats,  bearing over her ladyship a canopy of blue velvet. This group included  the Duchess of Sutherland, as Charlotte Corday in a gown of red _crepe  de Chine_, a muslin fichu and cap, trimmed with point d'Alencon lace,  and dagger at waist. Lady Westmorland made a lovely Hebe, and Lady  Angela Forbes, as the Queen of Naples, wore an Empire gown of ivory  duchesse satin, embroidered with silver and diamonds, and a train of  lilac velvet, edged with jewelled embroidery and lined with satin. The  head-dress consisted of a small jewelled crown and two white feathers.  Among many other notable costumes should be mentioned the Marchioness of  Tweedale's, as the Empress Josephine, as she appears in the Coronation  picture at the Louvre, Paris; the Marchioness of Londonderry, as the  Empress Marie Therese, of Austria, and the Marchioness of Zetland's, as  Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I. of England; Viscountess  Raincliffe, as the Empress Catherine II. of Russia, wore white satin,  and her dress was an exact copy of the picture in the British Museum by  Lambi. The Court gown of the Duchess of Portland, as Duchesse de Savoia,  who headed the Venetian procession, was composed of white satin veiled,  with lisse wrought with silver, partially covered by a silver cloth  mantle, embroidered with pearls and diamonds, and diamonds and emeralds  were introduced in the coiffure.</span></div></div>
