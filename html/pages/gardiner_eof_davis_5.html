<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.5</span><span class="cts_passage">A well-shaped foot has been considered from the earliest times one of  Nature's kindest gifts, and sober history and fairy lore have combined  to give us many interesting particulars respecting this portion of the  human anatomy. The similarity of the foot-gear of both sexes makes it  impossible to treat the matter separately, and as the subject is  practically inexhaustible, I propose only to illustrate the most curious  and notable examples.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.6</span><span class="cts_passage">One of the finest collection of shoes in the world is that at the Cluny  Museum, Paris, formed by the eminent French engraver, the late Jules  Jacquemart. This was enlarged by the purchase of the collection of Baron  Schvitter. The Queen of Italy has also acquired a large number of  historical boots and shoes; and to Mr. Joseph Box, another enthusiastic  collector, I am indebted for some of the drawings used for illustrating  this article.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.7</span><span class="cts_passage">A quaint story is told in a rare book, entitled "The Delightful,  Princely, and Entertaining History of the Gentle Craft of Crispin, the  Patron Saint of Shoe Makers, and his Brother Crispianus." According to  this authority, they were the two sons of the King of Logia (Kent), and  lived in the city of Durovenum, otherwise Canterbury, or the Court of  the Kentish men. Having embraced Christianity, during the Roman  invasion, they were in considerable danger, and at their mother's  instigation, to conceal their identity, adopted humble attire, and  devoted themselves to the modest craft of shoemaking, under the auspices  of a shoemaker at Faversham, to whom they bound themselves for seven  years. This industrious citizen appears to have received the appointment  of shoemaker to the Court of Maximinus, whose daughter Ursula fell in  love with Crispin. After removing the usual obstacles (which, even in  those remote times, seem to have obstructed the paths of those who had  fallen under the sway of Cupid), this energetic lady engaged the  services of a neighbouring friar, and cut the gordian knot by marrying  her faithful adorer.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.8</span><span class="cts_passage">When primitive man first conceived the idea of producing some  contrivance to defend himself from cold, sharp stones, or the heated  sand of the desert, his first effort was to fasten to the bottom of his  feet soles of bark, wood, or raw hide, which were followed, in due  course, by more elaborately made sandals of tanned leather. These were  fastened in various ways, but generally by two leathern straps, one  round the instep, while the other passed between the first and second  toes. Egyptian sandals were sometimes prolonged to a sharp point, and  occasionally were made of papyrus, or some flexible material; but the  commoner kinds were, as a rule, of wood or leather. Often they had  painted upon them the effigy of the wearer's enemy, who was thus  literally trodden underfoot. Owing to their proximity, the habits and  customs of the Egyptians and Jews were in many respects similar. The  same Hebrew word denotes both a sandal and a shoe; and it has been  concluded that shoes were probably confined to the upper classes, while  sandals were used by those compelled to work; and slaves went  barefoot.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.9</span><span class="cts_passage">It will be seen from the sketches of Grecian and Roman shoes that they  eventually became an elaborate article of dress, bound to the foot and  leg with lacings, and ornamented in different ways. The senators had  boots of black leather, with a crest of gold or silver on the top of the  foot; and soldiers wore iron shoes, heavily spiked, in a similar manner  to those now used for cricket, so as to give the wearers a better hold  when scaling walls in the attack of fortified places. An iron boot was  also used for torturing Christians. As an instance of the luxury so  characteristic of the age, it is stated that Roman soldiers often had  the spikes on their shoes made of gold. According to the testimony of  Seneca, Julius CAesar wore shoes of the precious metal, a fashion  emulated by Cardinal Wolsey many centuries after; and Severus was fond  of covering his with jewels, to attract the attention of the people as  he walked through the streets. The Emperor Aurelian forbade men to wear  red, yellow, white, or green shoes, reserving these colours for women;  and different shapes were prescribed by legal enactments to be worn for  the easy distinguishment of various trades and professions. In the reign  of Domitian, the stalls of shoemakers in the public streets were so  numerous as to necessitate an edict for their removal.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.11</span><span class="cts_passage">Our own ancestors, the Anglo-Saxons, wore shoes of raw cow-hide,  reaching to the ankles; and the hair turned outward. Those used by  ecclesiastics were a kind of sandal fastened with bands of leather round  the instep. The Norman half-boots had soles of wood, while the uppers  were of a more pliable material. Those worn by the Crusaders were of  chain, and later of plate armour. Very pointed toes were in fashion  during the Middle Ages, and these were carried to such a ridiculous  length that the dignitaries of the Church considered it necessary to  preach against the practice. However, this did not result in its  abolition, for we find the courtiers of the day improved upon the  prevailing mode by stuffing their shoes, and twisting them into the  shape of a ram's horn; the point of which was attached to the knee by a  chain. The common people were permitted by law to wear "the pykes on  their shoon" half-a-foot, rich citizens a foot, while nobles and princes  had theirs two-and-a-half feet long.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.12</span><span class="cts_passage">During the Plantagenet period it was usual to wear two shoes of  different colours, and they were often slashed on the upper surface, to  show the bright hose beneath. These were superseded by a large, padded  shoe, gored over the foot with coloured material, a fashion imported  from Italy, and exaggerated as much as the pointed shoe had been.  Buskins were high boots, made of splendid tissue, and worn by the  nobility and gentry during the Middle Ages, generally on occasions of  State. They were also largely adopted by players of tragedy. They  covered the knee, and were tied just below. The sock, or low shoe, on  the other hand, was the emblem of comedy.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.13</span><span class="cts_passage">One of the greatest follies ever introduced was the chopine, a sort of  stilt which increased the height of the wearer. These were first used in  Persia, but appeared in Venice about the Sixteenth Century, and their  use was encouraged by jealous husbands in the hope of keeping their  wives at home. This desire, however, was not realised, as the ladies  went out as usual, and required rather more support than hitherto.  Chopines were very ornate, and the length determined the rank of the  wearer, the noblest dames having them half-a-yard high. Shakespeare  refers to them when he makes Hamlet say:--"Your ladyship is nearer  heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine." He also  alludes to the general use of shoes for the left and right foot, when he  speaks of a man:---</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i033.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.16</span><span class="cts_passage">The exercise of the gentle craft of shoemaking was for a long time  carried on in monastic institutions, and increased the revenues of the  clergy. Richard, the first Abbot of St. Albans, objected to canons and  priests of his era associating themselves with tanners and shoemakers,  not one of whom, in his opinion, ought to be made a bishop or an abbot.  It is said, however, that Pope John, elected in 1316, was the son of a  shoemaker at Cahors; and in the description of Absalom, the Parish  Clerk, Chaucer tells us, "the upper leathers of his shoes were carved to  resemble the windows of St. Paul's Cathedral," which inclines one to  believe in their priestly origin.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.18</span><span class="cts_passage">[Illustration: MEDIAeVAL SHOES.]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.19</span><span class="cts_passage">From various sources, we have descriptions of royal shoes. Richard  C[oe]ur de Lion had his boots striped with gold; those of his brother  John were spotted with gold in circles. Henry III. had his boots  chequered with golden lines, and every square enriched with a lion. In  the splendid Court of Edward III., the royal shoes were elaborately  embroidered. The coronation shoes of Richard III. were covered with  crimson tissue cloth of gold. Henry VIII. is described as wearing  square-toed shoes, which were slashed with coloured silk, and exposed a  portion of the foot. Some worn by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth, of  brocaded silk, are remarkably clumsy in appearance, and have lappets  which fasten over the instep. They form a striking contrast to those  used by the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots (now in the possession of  Sir James William Drummond), which are of kid, embroidered with coloured  silks; the toes are somewhat squarer, but in other respects resemble  those in fashion at the present day.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.25</span><span class="cts_passage">In speaking of curious foot-gear, the under covering of the leg and  pedal extremities must be briefly referred to. Ancient works on costume  frequently mention hose, socks, and stockings, which were made of  woollen cloth, leather, or linen, and held in place by cross-bands of  the material twisted to a little below the knee, either in close rolls,  like the hay-bands of the modern ostler, or crossing each other  sandal-wise, as they are now worn in some districts of Europe,  particularly in Russia and Spain. Cloth stockings, embroidered with  gold, are among the articles of dress ordered by Henry III. for his  sister Isabel; and of a woman mentioned in the "Canterbury Tales," it  is said: "Hire hosen weren of fine scarlet redde, ful streite yteyed  (tied), and shoon full moist (supple) and newe."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i035.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.27</span><span class="cts_passage">In the reign of Henry VII. clocks on stockings are discernible; and the  Poet Laureate of this king, describing the dress of the hostess of an  inn, gives an indication of how boots were cleaned:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.28</span><span class="cts_passage">"She hobbles as she goes,  With her blanket hose,  Her shoone smeared with _tallow_."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.29</span><span class="cts_passage">It is supposed that hose or stockings of silk were unknown in this  country before the middle of the 16th century. A pair of Spanish silk  hose was presented by Sir Thomas Gresham to Edward VI., his father never  having worn any but those made of cloth. In the reign of good Queen  Bess, nether socks or stockings were of silk, jarnsey, worsted crewel,  or the finest yarn, thread, or cloth, and were of all colours,  "cunningly knit and curiously indented in every point, with querks,  clocks, open seams, and everything else accordingly." Planche states, in  the third year of Elizabeth, Mistress Montague, the Queen's silk-woman,  presented Her Majesty with a pair of black silk knit stockings, made in  England; and from that time she wore no others, in the laudable desire  to encourage their home manufacture by her own example. The Queen's  patronage, and the invention, in 1599, of a weaving frame, by William  Lee, Master of Arts, and Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, gave a  great impetus tus to the stocking trade, which has been carried on with  considerable success ever since, particularly in the Midland counties of  England.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.30</span><span class="cts_passage">Spurs can be traced back to the Anglo-Saxon period, which is quite far  enough for this purpose. They had no rowels, but were made with a simple  point like a goad, and were fastened with leathers. Early in the 15th  century spurs were screwed on to a steel shoe, instead of being fastened  with straps. They were long in the neck, and the spikes of the rowels of  formidable dimensions. From a sketch of a spur worn at the Battle of  Naseby, in the reign of Charles I., it will be seen that, as progress  was made in armour and military gear, considerable attention was paid to  this portion of the soldier's outfit; indeed, it was more elaborate in  design than is now considered necessary. From a very early period spurs  have been used by both sexes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.31</span><span class="cts_passage">A curious custom was in vogue at the beginning of the present century  for ladies to make their own indoor shoes. This fashion was inaugurated  by Queen Charlotte, who was particularly deft in handling a beautiful  set of shoemaker's tools, mounted in silver, with ivory handles.  Tradesmen bitterly complained that worktables in boudoirs were strewn  with the implements of their craft; but, like many other feminine fads,  it soon passed away. About this period clogs were also used. These were  made of wood, and served as a protection to shoes out of doors. A  similar contrivance, with the addition of an iron ring, leather strap  and toe-cap, is still sometimes worn by farm servants, and is called a  patten. Another form of clog, consisting of a laced leather boot with  wooden sole, is extensively used by the working classes in the North of  England, and the sabot, a wooden shoe, is the ordinary foot-gear of  peasants on the Continent.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.32</span><span class="cts_passage">It is well known that Chinese women of high rank deform their feet by  compressing them in such a manner that it is afterwards almost  impossible to walk; and in Davis' interesting description of the Empire  of China, he relates that whenever a judge of unusual integrity resigns  his post, the people accompany him from his home to the gates of the  city, where his boots are drawn off with great ceremony, and are  afterwards preserved in the Hall of Justice.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.33</span><span class="cts_passage">In Japan a peculiar wooden sandal, having a separate compartment for the  great toe, is in common use. Straw slippers are also worn, and a  traveller starting on a journey will strap a supply on his back, so that  he may have new shoes in case of need. They are lefts and rights, and  only cost a halfpenny the pair. Here one never finds those deformities  of the feet so common in China, and even in our own country. A graceful  carriage depends so much upon the shoes worn. Heavy and stiff ones  oblige the wearer to plant the foot solidly at every step. If the toes  are very pointed it is at the sacrifice of elasticity, and if the heels  are too high the muscles in the ball of the foot are little used.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Orientals indicate reverence by uncovering their feet, and do so on all  occasions when Western nations would remove their hats. Their heads,  being generally shaven, are always covered, and are surmounted by a  head-dress which could not be replaced without considerable trouble;  while for the feet they have loose slippers, with a single sole, made of  coloured morocco or embroidered silk, which are easily thrown off. Few  things inspire them with greater disgust than for anyone to enter their  rooms with shoes on. They think such conduct an insult to themselves and  a pollution to their apartment; and it is considered the height of  irreverence to enter a church, mosque, or a temple without removing  them. Even classical heathenism affords instances of this usage. The  Roman women were obliged to go barefoot in the Temple of Vesta; the same  rule existed in that of Diana, at Crete; and those who prayed in the  Temple of Jupiter also followed this custom.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iv.35</span><span class="cts_passage">In the East, the public removal of the sandal or shoe, and the giving it  to another, accompanied by certain words, signifies a transfer of  authority or relinquishing possession. We are told in the case of Ruth  and Boaz, when her kinsman gave up his right to marry her, in favour of  her second husband, "he drew off his shoe." Among the Bedouins, when a  man permits his cousin to marry another, or divorces his runaway spouse,  he generally says, "She was my slipper; I have cast her off." Again,  when shoes are left at the door of an apartment, they denote that the  master or mistress is engaged, and even a husband does not venture into  a wife's room while he sees the slippers on the threshold. The idea is  not altogether unknown among ourselves, as it is expressed in the homely  proverb, "to stand in another man's shoes;" or when we speak of coming  into a future inheritance as stepping into a "dead man's shoe." Also in  flinging the slipper after a departing bride, signifying that the father  transfers his authority to the husband.</span></div></div>
