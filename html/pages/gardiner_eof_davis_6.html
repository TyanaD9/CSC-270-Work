<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i039.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.4</span><span class="cts_passage">Certain curious customs have been associated with the Ordinance of  Marriage from a very early period, and among others may be mentioned the  union of near relations in barbaric or semi-barbaric tribes; the  providing of husbands and wives for a family according to seniority (so  that the younger members had to possess their souls in patience till the  elder ones were disposed of); the paying of an equivalent for the  bride's services to her father in money or kind; and festivities often  lasting over several days to celebrate the nuptials. The Rabbins  acquaint us with the fact that seven days' feasting was an indispensable  obligation on all married men, and that the bride was not consigned to  her husband until after the days of feasting had expired. They were  generally spent in the house of the woman's father, after which she was  conducted in great state to her husband's home. When the bride was a  widow, the festivities only lasted for three days. Customs in the East  are perpetuated from one generation to another, and we now find among  the inhabitants of the Orient the same mode of life as was adopted by  the patriarchs of old. The description of the wooing of Isaac and  Rebekah, for example, so graphically told in Genesis, differs in few  respects from that of a young couple of the same rank in the present  day. Handsome presents, consisting of jewels, apparel, &c., are  presented to the woman and her family, and form part of her dower in  case of divorce. Rich shawls, fine dresses, personal ornaments, money,  and a complete outfit of domestic utensils are always included in such a  gift. Among some of the Arab tribes the dower received on such  occasions, and called the "five articles," consists of a carpet, a  silver nose ring, a silver neck chain, silver bracelets, and a camel  bag. Matrimonial overtures are generally made by the parents of the  contracting parties in Persia, but after all has been concluded, the  bride-elect has nominally the power, though it is seldom exercised, of  expressing her dissent before the connection receives its final  sanction. Among many Bedouin tribes the woman is not suffered to know  until the betrothing ceremonies announce it to her who is to be her  husband, and then it is too late to negative the contract, but she is  permitted to withdraw from her husband's tent the day after her  marriage, and to return to her father; in which case she is formally  divorced, and is henceforward regarded as a widow. On the value of her  ornaments the Eastern bride bases her claim to consideration; and though  the Arab, as a rule, cares little for his own dress, he decks his wife  as richly as possible, that honour may be reflected upon himself and his  circumstances. The leg ornaments and bracelets are often enormously  thick, and have no fastenings, but open and compress by their own  elasticity. It is not unusual to wear several on the same arm, reaching  to the elbow. They form a woman's sole wealth, and are not treasured up  for special occasions, as is usual among Western nations, but are used  as part of of the daily costume. Various materials are employed in their  manufacture; gold is necessarily rare, silver less so, while others are  composed of amber, coral, mother-of-pearl, and beads.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.7</span><span class="cts_passage">We are told, when Rebekah approached her future home and saw a man  walking in the distance, she evinced a curiosity, natural under the  circumstances, and inquired about him; and on discovering that it was  Isaac, "she took a veil and covered herself." It is still almost  universal in the East for a woman, whose face is not concealed on other  occasions, to envelop her head and body in an ample veil before she is  conducted to her husband, and it is considered an indispensable part of  the bridal costume. The details of the home coming are modified by the  local usages and religions of the different countries. In Syria, Persia,  and India, the bridegroom, in person, brings home the bride; in some  other countries this duty devolves on a near relative, and he remains at  home to receive the lady on her arrival. From various sources, but  particularly from indications in Scripture, we may gather that the Jews  employed either of these methods, according to circumstances. Again, in  Egypt the bridegroom goes to the Mosque when his bride is expected, and  returns home in procession after she has arrived. In Western Asia the  procession usually walks, if the bride's future house is at no great  distance in the same town. In such cases she is often partially covered  by a canopy, and in Central and Eastern Asia it is the rule for her to  be mounted on a mare, mule, ass, or camel, unless she is carried in a  palanquin. Much, of course, depends on the social position of those  married. Music attends such processions, and often dancing; the Jews  certainly had the former, and some think the latter also, at least, in  the time of our Saviour.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i041.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.9</span><span class="cts_passage">In Halhed's translation of the Gentoo Laws, and in Mr. Roberts's  "Oriental Illustrations," reference is made to the custom of marrying  the elder sister first, and the same usage is observed with regard to  the brothers. When, in India, the elder daughter happens to be blind,  deaf, dumb, or deformed, this formality is dispensed with; and there  have been cases when a man, wishing to obtain a younger daughter, has  used every means in his power to promote the settlement of his future  sister-in-law, so as to forward his own nuptials. Fathers, too, will  sometimes exert their powers to compass the marriage of the elder  daughter, when a very advantageous offer is made for the younger one.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.10</span><span class="cts_passage">It is generally believed that Psalm xlv., commonly known as "The Song of  Loves," was composed on the occasion of Solomon's marriage--probably to  Pharaoh's daughter; and here we find the Egyptian bride's dress  described as "all glorious within and wrought of gold, a raiment of  needlework." Both expressions refer to the same dress, and imply that  the garment was embroidered with figures worked with threads of gold.  The Egyptians were famous for their embroideries, and some mummies have  been found wrapped up in clothing curiously ornamented with gold lace.  At the present day, both in Egypt and Western Asia, it is usual for  ladies of the highest rank to employ much of their time in working with  the needle linen and cotton tissues in gold and silver thread and silk  of different colours.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i041b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.12</span><span class="cts_passage">The use of nuptial crowns is of great antiquity. Among the Greeks and  Romans they wore chaplets of flowers and leaves, and the modern Greeks  retain this custom, employing such chaplets, decorated with ribbons and  lace. Modern Jews do not use crowns in their marriage ceremonies, and  they inform us that they have been discontinued since the last siege of  Jerusalem by the Romans. The information which Gemara gives on this  subject is briefly that the crown of the bridegroom was of gold and  silver, or else a chaplet of roses, myrtle, or olives, and that the  bride's crown was of the precious metals. There is also some mention of  a crown made of salt and sulphur, worn by the bridegroom, the salt  transparent as crystal, the figures being represented thereon in  sulphur. Crowns play an important part in the nuptial ceremonies of the  Greek Church; they are also still used by Scandinavian brides.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.13</span><span class="cts_passage">The ring in former days did not occupy the prominent position it does  now, but was given, with other presents, to mark the completion of the  contract. Its form is a symbol of eternity, and signifies the intention  of both parties to keep the solemn covenant of which it is a pledge, or,  as the Saxons called it, a "wed," from which we derive the term wedding.  The Jews have a law which proclaims that the nuptial ring shall be of  certain value, and must not be obtained by credit or gift. Formerly they  were of large size and elaborate workmanship, but now the ordinary plain  gold hoop is used.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i042.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.15</span><span class="cts_passage">A wedding ring of the Shakespearian era has a portrait of Lucretia  holding the dagger, the reverse side of the circle being formed by two  clasped hands. This is a very common shape, and is shown in the  illustration of the English wedding-ring E, dated 1706, where white  enamel fingers support a rose diamond. The modern Italian peasant  wedding-ring B is of gold in raised bosses, while C is of silver; F,  bearing initials on vezet, is of bronze. A is a handsome Jewish  wedding-ring, bearing the ark, and D also has a Hebrew inscription.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.16</span><span class="cts_passage">The gimmal betrothal ring was formerly a favourite pattern, and  consisted of three circlets attached to a spring or pivot, and could be  closed so as to appear like one solid ring. It was customary to break  these asunder at the betrothal, the man and woman taking the upper and  lower ones, and the witness the intermediate ring. When the marriage  took place these were joined together and used at the ceremony. During  the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was a common practice to  engrave these emblems of affection with some appropriate motto. It was  from Pagan Rome that European nations derive the wedding-ring, as they  were used in their betrothals long before there is any trace of them  elsewhere.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i042b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.18</span><span class="cts_passage">In describing the bridal costumes of different nations, it should be  distinctly borne in mind that a large majority of the upper classes wear  on such occasions the traditional white satin and orange blossoms with  which we are all familiar. Many, however, prefer the picturesque  national costume associated with the land of their birth, and it has  been my principal object, in selecting the illustrations, to make them  as typical as possible.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i043.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.20</span><span class="cts_passage">(_From South Kensington Museum_)]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.21</span><span class="cts_passage">The Greek marriage service is full of symbol, and the sketch gives a  good idea of the bridal costume. The bridesmaid is attired in a gold  embroidered jacket, a skirt of brilliant colouring, and the crimson  fez--the usual head-gear of a Greek maiden. She is depicted scattering  corn, an ancient rite always performed at the conclusion of the  ceremony. As she gracefully sways backwards and forwards, to the  accompaniment of the jingling coins, which do double service as dowry  and trimming, it is a pose and dress at once graceful and free. Formerly  a wedding garment was often passed down from mother to daughter, and  such an example is given in the soft yellow silk robe, lined with white  and enriched with elaborate embroidery. Tiny stars in delicate shades of  red, blue, and green, divided by black lines form the design and  proclaim the industry and skill of the worker. These robes, however,  have not been used in Greece since the beginning of the seventeenth  century.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.22</span><span class="cts_passage">In Japan, the beautiful land of the lily and chrysanthemum, the bride  usually takes little more to her husband's home than her trousseau,  which is ample enough, as a rule, to satisfy even a woman's passion for  dress. The nuptials take place in the evening, and the bride is garbed  in virgin white robes, figured with a lozenge design. These garments are  the gift of the bridegroom, and in them she passes from the home of her  girlhood to that of her husband. The household gods of both families are  assembled before an altar decked with flowers and covered with  offerings. Near stands a large table, with a dwarf cedar; it also holds  the Japanese Adam and Eve, and the mystic turtle and stork. The two  special attendants of bride and bridegroom are called butterflies, and  in their dress and colouring rival these beautiful insects, which in  this country are the symbol of conjugal felicity. The most solemn part  of the marriage ceremony is the scene of the two-mouthed vase. At a  signal, one butterfly fills the vase, and the other offers it to the  kneeling couple, the husband drinking first, and afterwards the wife.  This draught signifies that henceforward they are to partake equally of  the bitters and sweets of the coming years. Rice is thrown from either  side, so as to mingle, and the wicks of two candles are placed together,  to symbolize the joining of body and soul.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.23</span><span class="cts_passage">The marriage processions of other Oriental nations have already been  referred to, and in India it is customary to perform the ceremony under  a species of canopy richly ornamented and lighted by lamps. The bride  wears, in addition to the native costume, a curious veil composed of  strings of gold beads and tassels. In Hindu marriages the sacred fire or  _oman_ (which is constantly renewed by throwing upon it scented oils,  sandalwood, incense, and other aromatic perfumes) is a prominent  feature, and the union of a couple is consecrated by sprinkling a  handful of saffron, mixed with rice flour, on their shoulders. Finally,  the husband presents his wife with a little golden image called _talee_,  a substitute for the wedding ring, and worn by Indian women as their  symbol of matrimony.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.24</span><span class="cts_passage">A missionary thus describes a Buddhist marriage:--"The bride, loaded  with jewellery, accompanied by women richly attired, entered the room,  and sat down with the bridegroom on the floor. A number of candles were  then lighted, and the company saluted and congratulated the happy  couple, and expressed their kind wishes by blowing smoke towards them,  while a band of string instruments discoursed sweet music. Two cushions  were placed before the bridegroom, on which a sword was laid, and food  was also near them. Next the hands of each were bound together, then the  two to each other with silken threads. This act was performed by the  nearest relative present, and completed the ceremony." Brief, indeed,  are the forms of marriage indulged in by the people of Borneo. Each of  the contracting parties chews a betel nut; an elderly woman mutters some  sort of incantation, and brings the heads of bride and bridegroom in  close contact, after which they are declared man and wife, and are no  longer regarded as twain, but one flesh. The Cherokee form of marriage  is perhaps the most simple. The two join hands over a running stream,  emblematic of the wish that their future lives, hopes, and aspirations,  should flow on in the same channel. A peculiar custom of the Lascars is  the putting of a ring on the great toe when they marry. Mrs. Bishop, who  has explored Tibet and studied the habits and customs of the people,  informs us that polyandry is favoured by the women of that country. The  heir of the land and eldest son appears to be the only member of the  family who can contract a marriage in the legal sense as we understand  it, but all his brothers are accepted by the wife as inferior or  subordinate husbands. By this means they are kept well under the control  of the superior husband, whom they regard as the "Big Father," and, as a  matter of form, any children who may be born are accepted by him.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i044.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Thus the whole family are attached to the soil, and seem to work in  concord, and the women have the satisfaction of knowing that in the  average course of Nature they can never become widows, and that there  will always be someone to work for them and their offspring. "It is the  custom for the men and women of a village to assemble when a bride  enters her home with her husbands, and for each of them to present her  with three rupees. The Tibetan wife, far from spending these gifts on  personal adornment, looks ahead, contemplating possible contingencies,  and immediately hires a field, the produce of which is her own, and  accumulates from year to year, so that she may not be portionless should  she desire a divorce."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.27</span><span class="cts_passage">The African tribes, of course, differ materially in their marriage  customs, but some form of exchange for the services of the woman are  insisted on, and often take the shape of a present of cattle to the  bride's father. On the West Coast, in the neighbourhood of Gaboon,  where slavedom is recognised, there is an understanding that a wife may  be purchased for a slave bundle, valued at about E6 in English money,  and there appears to be no sliding scale as to youth, beauty, form, or  degree. A bundle contains specimens of every article sold by a general  storekeeper. The most important features of a slave bundle are a  Neptune, or brass pan used for making salt, which is a current article  of commerce, and a piece of native cloth, manufactured by these people  for dress purposes, from a species of palm which grows on the river  banks in great luxuriance. Both sexes anoint themselves with palm oil  and other greasy substances, and no greater compliment can be paid to an  African belle than to say she looks "fat and shining."</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i045b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.30</span><span class="cts_passage">Mr. Hutchinson, in his interesting work, "Ten Years in Aethiopia," gives  a quaint and amusing account of the toilet of a Fernandian bridegroom:  "Outside a small hut, belonging to the mother of the bride expectant, I  soon discovered the happy bridegroom undergoing his toilet at the hands  of his future wife's sister. A profusion of Tshibbu strings being  fastened round his body, as well as his legs and arms, the anointing  lady, having a short black pipe in her mouth, proceeded to rub him over  with Tola pomade. He seemed not altogether joyous at the anticipation of  his approaching happiness, but turned a sulky gaze now and then on a  piece of yam which he held in his hand, and which had a parrot's red  feather fixed on its convex side. This was called 'Ntshoba,' and is  regarded as a protection against evil influences on the important day.  The bride was borne down by the weight of rings and wreaths and girdles  of Tshibbu. Tola pomatum gave her the appearance of an exhumed mummy,  save her face, which was all white; not from excess of modesty, for the  negro race are reported to blush blue, but from being smeared over with  a white paste, the emblem of purity." What a hideous substitute for the  classical wreath of orange blossoms, and what a contrast must be offered  when the cosmetic peels off and displays the dusky skin upon which it is  laid!</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.31</span><span class="cts_passage">According to Russian law, no man can marry before he is eighteen years  of age, or a woman before she is sixteen; nor after he is eighty, and  she is sixty. Priests are permitted to marry once. Secret marriages  without witnesses are regarded as invalid, and both bride and bridegroom  must be baptized persons. If a Russian takes a foreigner for a wife, she  must bind herself in writing to bring up any children she may have in  the Greco-Russian faith. According to an ancient custom the bridegroom  presents his bride with the costume and jewellery worn at the marriage.  The dowry comes from her family, and consists of a complete wardrobe,  silver, linen, and household furniture of all kinds. The hair of an  unmarried woman of the peasant class in Russia is dressed in a single  plait hanging loose upon the shoulders, and tied with ribbon. After  marriage it is arranged in two braids coiled round the head, covered  with a cap tied behind, or with a cotton or silk handkerchief and a  little lappet of linen rests on the forehead, and is considered an  inevitable symbol of marriage. Marriages are performed after banns, and  much of the finery used by the lower classes is hired for the occasion;  and the crowns used in the Russian ceremony are generally the property  of the Church. Formerly they were worn for a week, but this practice has  been discontinued.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i046b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.34</span><span class="cts_passage">There are three distinct periods in the life of a Norwegian woman, and  each one has marked characteristics, particularly as regards dress.  During girlhood, up to the time of confirmation, a solemn occasion for  which there is much preparatory training, girls do not usually go from  home to work, or earn their own living. Among the poorer classes this  ceremony takes place when they are about fifteen. Their petticoats are  short and their hair is arranged in two long plaits. After confirmation  they are supposed to regard life from its more serious aspect, and to  engage themselves with various duties, according to their station. The  third stage, of course, is married life, and it should be stated that  neither men nor women can enter upon the holy contract unless they can  bring proof of their confirmation, and can show ample evidence of  sufficient means to provide for a household. The marriage is preceded by  a betrothal ceremony, when the young couple go to the church,  accompanied by their friends, and exchange rings of plain gold and  presents of jewellery and apparel, which must be worn on the wedding  day. At her marriage the peasant bride wears the crown. It has a rim of  brass to fit the head, and the upper portion is of silver and gold,  sometimes embellished with precious stones. Such crowns are generally  heirlooms, and it is not uncommon for all the brides of one family for  centuries to wear the same adornment for the head. A very usual dress on  such an occasion is a plain skirt of some woollen material, with a  bodice and full sleeves of snowy linen, a corselet of red and green,  ornamented with bands and buckles, and a white apron trimmed with  embroidery. A silver-gilt breast ornament is worn by Swedish brides. The  band is wrought with bosses, and depending from it are small beaten  discs, and a medallion bearing the sacred initials I.H.S. The  bridegroom's hat in the illustration was probably an heirloom too, from  its shape and fashion. He wears a red waistcoat cut short and fastened  with brass buttons, and a loose cloth coat ornamented with embroidered  revers. The black small clothes show to advantage a well-shaped leg, and  on the feet are low shoes. Usually the festivities in connection with a  peasant wedding in Norway are kept up for three days, and during the  time there is much feasting and merrymaking among the friends of bride  and bridegroom.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i047b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.37</span><span class="cts_passage">Gipsies are, as a rule, married at a very early age. A girl is generally  betrothed at fourteen, and becomes a wife two years later. The marriage  ceremony is performed by a priest wearing a ram's horn as a sign of  office, and, as becomes a nomadic race, the four elements--fire, air,  earth, and water--take a prominent position. The horn is the symbol of  authority, and is often made use of in Scripture. So much were rams'  horns esteemed by the Israelites that their priests and Levites used  them as trumpets in the taking of Jericho; and modern Jews when they  confess their sins announce the ceremony by blowing a ram's horn. In  ancient Egypt and other parts of Africa, Jupiter Ammon was worshipped  under the figure of a ram, and to this deity one of these animals was  sacrificed annually. It seems to have been an emblem of power from the  remotest ages. It would therefore appear that the practice of the gipsy  priest wearing a ram's horn suspended from a string round his neck at a  marriage is derived from the highest antiquity, and undoubtedly points  to the Oriental origin of the gipsy race.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.38</span><span class="cts_passage">Various expedients have been resorted to by different rulers of sparsely  populated kingdoms to encourage men to enter the married state. In  ancient Rome the law forbade that a bachelor should inherit any legacy  whatever, and in Sparta, under the rule of Lycurgus, they were not  permitted to have a part in the government, nor might they occupy any  civil or military post. They were excluded from participation in public  festivals, except on certain fixed occasions, and then the women had the  right to lead them to the altars, where they were beaten with rods to  the sound of scornful songs. As late as the reign of William and Mary,  widowers were taxed in England at the following rates:--Dukes, E12 10s.;  lower peers a smaller sum, and commoners one shilling each, if they  elected to remain in a state of single blessedness. Widows also,  especially those of high degree and fortune, were encouraged to dip  again in the matrimonial lottery, and children were betrothed at a very  tender age.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i048.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.40</span><span class="cts_passage">Bridesmaids in Anglo-Saxon times attended on the bride, and performed  specified duties, particularly in the festivities which usually followed  on such occasions. Even during the earlier portion of the present  century it was a common custom for one to accompany the bridal couple on  their honeymoon; and it was also her duty to prepare and present the  "benediction posset," which is referred to by Herrick in "Hesperides:"--</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.41</span><span class="cts_passage">"A short sweet prayer shall be said,  And now the posset shall be made  With cream of lilies not of kine  And maiden blush for spiced wine."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.42</span><span class="cts_passage">The fashion of brides wearing spotless white is a comparatively modern  one. From accounts of bridal gowns in bygone times, we find rich  brocades, golden tissues, and coloured silks were employed for this  purpose; and at the present day white is considered only appropriate to  the virgin, and is absolutely dispensed with by those women who have  been married before.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">v.43</span><span class="cts_passage">Of modern marriage customs in England there is no occasion to speak, for  what woman is there among us who has not made an exhaustive and complete  study of this vital matter? It may, however, comfort those who are  beginning to wonder if marriage and giving in marriage is going out of  fashion, to know that during the first quarter of 1894, 95,366 persons  were joined together in the British Islands, an increase of 18 per cent.  over the first three months of the previous year, 1893 and 9 per cent.  over the mean rate for the same quarter for the preceding ten years.  Figures are incontrovertible facts, so our ears need no longer be  assailed by the bitter cry of "DARKEST SPINSTERDOM."</span></div></div>
