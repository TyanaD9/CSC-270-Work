<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.6</span><span class="cts_passage">The signs of mourning in ancient times were by no means confined to the  apparel. Fasting, laceration of the flesh, throwing dust on the head,  and shaving the hair, were outward and visible signs of grief,  accompanied by piercing cries of the most heartrending description. It  was also customary to abstain from ornaments, to rend the clothing, and  to put on filthy garments of sackcloth. This fabric was, and is still in  the East, made of hair, which has an irritating effect upon the skin,  and was for this purpose adopted as a penitential dress by the early  Roman Church. The covering of the head was another manifestation of  sorrow--a practice indicated by the hoods worn by female mourners, and  the flowing hat-bands for men, so common at funerals a few years ago. In  "A History of Mourning," by Richard Davey, from which many interesting  facts on this subject may be gathered, we learn that the Egyptians, over  three thousand years ago, selected yellow as the colour for mourning  garments. The Greeks chose black as the most appropriate--a fashion  followed by the Romans. The women of Rome had robes of black cloth, with  veils of the same shade; but by a wise dispensation, young children were  not compelled to adopt the symbols of woe. A year was the usual period  for mourning a husband, wife, father, mother, sister, or brother; but  relations who had been outlawed, imprisoned, or bankrupt, were not  accorded this mark of respect. Numa published certain laws for the  guidance of mourners, including one forbidding women to scratch their  faces, or to make an exceptional display of grief at funerals. The  Emperor Justinian (A.D. 537) also turned his attention to this subject,  and regulated the expenses at funeral ceremonies, so as to secure those  who remained from the double calamity of losing their friends and, at  the same time, incurring heavy pecuniary liabilities on their account.  Provision was made for burying each person free of cost, and for  protecting the survivors from various extortions. Funds were  appropriated for the purpose of interments, which were conducted by  those appointed for the purpose. All persons were to be buried in the  same manner; though those who desired to do so could, at their own cost,  indulge in certain display, but this additional expense was limited. On  state occasions, as, for example, on the death of an Emperor or a great  defeat, the whole nation assumed the mourning garb. The defeat of CannAe,  the conspiracy of Catalina, and the death of Julius CAesar, were all  considered of sufficient importance for the observance of this custom.  Private mourning could be broken among the Romans by certain domestic  events, as the birth of a son or daughter, the marriage of a child, or  the return of a prisoner taken in war. Both sexes were expected to  abstain from going to public ceremonies and places of amusement; and  women were not allowed to marry till a year had elapsed from the  husband's death, without the special permission of the Emperor. History,  however, does not record that their lords and masters applied this rule  to their own conduct.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.8</span><span class="cts_passage">The Greeks buried their dead before sunrise, so as to avoid ostentation.  Mourning women took part in the procession, and accompanied the chief  female mourner in her visits to the grave, on the seven days following  interment. This custom, which was derived from the East, was a usual  feature in Jewish, Roman, and Egyptian, as well as in Greek funerals.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.10</span><span class="cts_passage">The funeral feast was a common practice among the classical ancients,  and was kept up to a comparatively recent period, in various European  countries. The Cup of Consolation consisted of light refreshments  prepared and sent in by the friends of mourners, who were not supposed  to busy themselves with domestic affairs at such a time. The  illustration gives a good idea of the mourning habit adopted by the  immediate family of the deceased. Caves were used for the disposal of  the dead, as well as elaborately constructed sepulchres, of which many  remain to this day. Earth burial was in favour with some nations, but  in time of war or pestilence cremation was resorted to. The practice of  embalming we owe to the Egyptians, who carried it to a great state of  perfection. One of the earliest embalmments on record is that of Joseph,  whose body accompanied the Israelites on their journey through the  Wilderness. He was placed in a coffin, a distinction in the East only  accorded to those of the highest rank, the usual mode being to simply  swathe the corpse closely in wrappers and bandages, thus retaining the  shape of the human form. The Jews largely used spices and perfumes,  which were employed both for anointing and for wrapping up the body--a  very necessary precaution in hot climates. The Egyptians, on the death  of a relative or sacred animal (the cat, for instance), attired  themselves in yellow garments and shaved off their eyebrows. Their  funeral processions were magnificent. When a king quitted this mortal  sphere, the temples were closed for seventy-two days, and there were no  sacrifices, solemnities, or feasts. Companies of two or three hundred  men and women, in mean attire paraded the streets, singing plaintive  songs and reciting the virtues of him they had lost. They ate no meat,  or food dressed by fire, and omitted their customary baths and  anointings. Every one mourned as for the death of a favourite child, and  spent the day in lamentations. The Pyramids, those wonderful monuments  to Egyptian monarchs, are memorials of the reverence and industry of the  nation, whose high state of civilization is attested to by their works.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Burial clubs were common among the Anglo-Saxons, and heavy fines were  inflicted on those who did not attend the funeral of a member. The  corpse was placed on a bier, and on the body was laid the book of the  Gospels, a code of belief and a cross as a symbol of hope. A silken or  linen pall was used, according to the rank of the dead person. The  clergy bore lighted tapers and chanted the psalter, the mass was  performed, and a liberal offering made to the poor.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.15</span><span class="cts_passage">From a 9th century MS. in the National Library, Paris, is given a sketch  which clearly defines the mourning habit of that period. The gown is  evidently of black woollen cloth, trimmed with black and white fur; and  a gauze veil of the same sombre tint envelops the head. From the same  source a drawing of an Anglo-Saxon priest is given, on account of his  wearing a black dalmatic, edged with fur, a vestment only adopted when a  requiem mass was performed.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.18</span><span class="cts_passage">In the Middle Ages black was used for mourning as a rule, though purple  and brown were occasionally substituted. Chaucer, in "The Knight's  Tale," speaks of "clothes _black_ all dropped with tears," and, again,  of "widdowes habit of samite _brown_." In many cases, on the death of  her husband, the wife retired for a year to a convent, when she assumed  the nun's dress, of which the widow's weeds of the present day are a  symbol. The mourning adopted by Katherine of Valois, wife of Henry V.,  the hero of Agincourt, who died at Vincennes in 1422, may be regarded as  the typical widow's dress of that period. It consisted of a black  brocade cote hardi, edged with white fur, and further embellished with  black glass beads, which were also used for ornamenting the winged head  dress. Her black woollen gown has a deep bordering of white fur. Some  mourning habits of this period are represented in a splendid manuscript  "Liber Regalis," still preserved in Westminster Abbey. They are composed  of black fabrics in the prevailing fashion, and are furred with ermine.  Froissart relates that the Earl of Foix, on hearing of the death of his  son, Gaston, sent for his barber, and was close shaved, and clothed  himself and his household in black. At the funeral of the Earl of  Flanders, all the nobles and others present were attired in black gowns;  and on the death of John, King of France, the King of Cyprus clothed  himself in black mourning.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i055.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.20</span><span class="cts_passage">At the end of the fifteenth century, it was considered necessary in  England to pass sumptuary mourning laws, owing to the extravagance of  the nobility in the superfluous usage of cloth and other items at  funerals. Habits and liveries were limited to certain quantities.  Planche tells us dukes and marquises were allowed sixteen yards for  their gowns, sloppes (or mourning cassocks) and mantles; an earl,  fourteen; a viscount, twelve; a baron, eight; a knight, six; and all  inferior persons, two yards only; but an archbishop had the same  privilege as a duke. Hoods were only permitted to those above the degree  of esquire of the king's household.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i055b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Margaret, Countess of Richmond, the mother of King Henry VII., issued,  in the eighth year of his reign, an ordinance for "the reformation of  apparell for great estates of women in the tyme of mourninge." "They  shall have their surcottes with a trayne before and another behynde, and  their mantles with traynes. The queen is to wear a surcotte, with the  traynes as aforesaid, and playne hoode, and a tippet at the hoode lying  a good length upon the trayne of the mantell, being in breadth a nayle  and an inche. After the first quarter of a year, the hood to be lined  with black satin, or furred with ermine; and all ladies down to the  degree of a baroness, are to wear similar mourninge, and to be barbed at  the chin." The surcotte, with trayne, hood, barbe, and tippet, are  visible in the sketch of a lady of the sixteenth century, taken from  Pietro Vercellio's famous work on costume. The gentleman's mourning of  black cloth and fur, is reproduced from a contemporary MS.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.24</span><span class="cts_passage">Among the obsolete funeral customs, may be mentioned the Death Crier,  the lying-in-state of all classes, and the waxen effigies of those of  royal rank. Before newspapers published obituary notices, it was  customary for the Death Crier, armed with a bell and attired in a black  livery, painted or embroidered with skulls and cross-bones, to announce  to the townspeople, and inhabitants of surrounding villages, that  another had gone over to the majority. This functionary was in the  employ of the Corporation, or civil authorities, and on the death of a  member of the Royal Family, he was usually accompanied by the Guild of  Holy Souls, who walked in procession, bearing lighted tapers and other  religious emblems. Lying-in-state usually lasted for three days, by  which time the arrangements for a simple interment were completed, and  the body was placed reverently in the ground. The obsequies of kings and  queens, however, were carried over a protracted period, consequently a  waxen figure was prepared, which was dressed in regal robes, and  substituted for the body as soon as decomposition set in. This fashion  was in vogue till the time of William and Mary, and in Westminster Abbey  there is a collection of waxen effigies, which may be viewed by  permission of the Dean. As likenesses they are interesting, and they are  also useful as costume studies.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.26</span><span class="cts_passage">Of late years, in this country, mourning has been considerably modified,  particularly for the male sex, who often content themselves with a  black hat-band and another on the left sleeve of dark-coloured clothes.  By Scotch law, whether a man dies solvent or insolvent, his widow may  claim out of his estate, sufficient for mourning suitable to her rank,  and the same privilege applies to each of her children, who are old  enough to be present at their father's funeral. This right takes  precedence over any debts the dead man may have contracted, and is a  distinction not accorded to English, Welsh, or Irish widows.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i057.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.28</span><span class="cts_passage">In most European countries black is the accepted colour for mourning;  though in different parts of the globe white, yellow, red, brown, and  even blue garments are prescribed by custom as the emblem of death.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vi.29</span><span class="cts_passage">These shades have been selected for the following reasons:--Black is  symbolical of the gloom which surrounds one when those who are nearest  and dearest are taken. Black and white express sorrow mixed with hope,  and white alone the light which follows the night of mourning. Blue, the  tint of the heavens, to which it is hoped the spirit forms have taken  flight. Yellow is typical of the dead autumn leaf, and brown the earth  to which the body returns. Violet, a royal colour, is generally used for  the mourning of kings and high dignitaries of the Church. Scarlet is  also used for royal mourning occasionally.[A]</span></div>
