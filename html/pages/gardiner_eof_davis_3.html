<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.6</span><span class="cts_passage">Holy Writ simply teems with allusions to the luxurious tresses of the  fair daughters of the East, and there is little doubt that at an early  period in the world's history women awakened to the fact that a  well-tired head was a very potent attraction, and had a recognised  market value. Jewish women were particularly famed in this respect, and  employed female barbers, who, with the aid of crisping pins, horns, and  towers, prepared their clients for conquest. These jewelled horns were  generally made of the precious metals, and the position denoted the  condition of the wearer. A married woman had it fixed on the right side  of the head, a widow on the left, and she who was still an  unappropriated blessing on the crown. Over the horn the veil was thrown  coquettishly, as in the illustration. Assyrian women delighted in long  ringlets, confined by a band of metal, and the men were not above the  weakness of plaiting gold wire with their beards. Rimmel, in "The Book  of Perfumes," relates a curious anecdote of Mausolus, King of Caria, who  turned his people's fondness for flowing locks to account when his  exchequer required replenishing. "Having first had a quantity of wigs  made and stored in the royal warehouses, he published an edict  compelling all his subjects to have their heads shaved. A few days  after, the monarch's agents went round, offering them the perukes  destined to cover their denuded polls, which they were delighted to buy  at any price". It is not surprising that Artemisia could not console  herself for the loss of such a clever husband, and that, not satisfied  with drinking his ashes dissolved in wine, she spent some of her  lamented lord's ill-gotten revenue in building such a monument to his  memory that it was counted one of the wonders of the world.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.8</span><span class="cts_passage">The Egyptians were also partial to wigs, some of which are still  preserved in the British Museum. Ladies wore a multitude of small plaits  and jewelled head-pieces resembling peacocks and other animals, which  contrasted with their dark tresses with brilliant effect; or a fillet  ornamented with a lotus bud. The coiffure of a princess was remarkable  for its size and the abundance of animal, vegetable, and mineral  treasures with which it was adorned. In Egyptian tombs and elsewhere  have been discovered small wooden combs resembling the modern  tooth-comb, and metal mirrors of precisely the same shape as those in  use at the present day, as well as numerous other toilet appliances.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.10</span><span class="cts_passage">Grecian sculpture affords us the opportunity of studying the different  modes in favour in that country, and it is astonishing to find what a  variety of methods were adopted by the belles of ancient Greece for  enhancing their charms. A loose knot, fastened by a clasp in the form of  a grasshopper, was a favourite fashion. Cauls of network, metal mitres  of different designs, and simple bands, and sometimes chaplets, of  flowers, all confined at different periods, the luxuriant locks of the  Helens, Penelopes, and Xantippes of ancient times.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.12</span><span class="cts_passage">It was a common custom among heathen nations to consecrate to their gods  the hair when cut off, as well as that growing on the head, and it was  either consumed on the altar, deposited in temples, or hung upon the  trees. A famous instance of the consecration of hair is that of  Berenice, the wife of Ptolemy Evergetes. It is related that when the  king went on his expedition to Syria, she, solicitous for his safety,  made a vow to consecrate her hair (which was remarkable for its fineness  and beauty) to Venus, if he returned to her. When her husband came back  she kept her word, and offered her hair in the temple of Cyprus. This  was afterwards missing, when a report was spread that it had been turned  into a constellation in the heavens, which constellation, an old writer  tells us, is called _Coma Berenices_ (the hair of Berenice) to the  present day. Another remarkable instance is that of Nero, who, according  to Suetonius, cut off his first beard, put it in a casket of gold set  with jewels, and consecrated it to Jupiter Capitolinus.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i016b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.14</span><span class="cts_passage">The hair of the head and beard appears to have been held in great  respect by most nations, and perhaps we may trace the use of human hair  in spells and incantations to this fact. Orientals especially treat the  hair which falls from them with superstitious care, and bury it, so  that no one shall use it to their prejudice.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Roman matrons generally preferred blonde hair to their own ebon tresses,  and resorted to wigs and dye when Nature, as they considered, had  treated them unkindly. Ovid rebukes a lady of his acquaintance in the  plainest terms for having destroyed her hair.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i017b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.19</span><span class="cts_passage">"Did I not tell you to leave off dyeing your hair? Now you have no hair  left to dye: and yet nothing was handsomer than your locks: they came  down to your knees, and were so fine that you were afraid to comb them.  Your own hand has been the cause of the loss you deplore: you poured the  poison on your own head. Now Germany will send you slaves' hair--a  vanquished nation will supply your ornament. How many times, when you  hear people praising the beauty of your hair, you will blush and say to  yourself: 'It is bought ornament to which I owe my beauty, and I know  not what Sicambrian virgin they are admiring in me. And yet there was a  time when I deserved all these compliments.'"</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.21</span><span class="cts_passage">It would puzzle any _fin de siecle_ husband or brother to express his  displeasure in more appropriate words than those chosen by the poet.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.22</span><span class="cts_passage">The Britons, before they mixed with other nations, were a fair-haired  race, and early writers referred to their washing their auburn tresses  in water boiled with lime to increase the reddish colour. Boadicea is  described with flowing locks which fell upon her shoulders; but after  the Roman Invasion the hair of both men and women followed the fashion  of the conquerors.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i018.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.24</span><span class="cts_passage">From Planche's "History of British Costume," we learn that "the female  head-dress among all classes of the Anglo-Saxons was a long piece of  linen or silk wrapped round the head and neck." It appears to have been  called a head-rail, or wimple, but was dispensed with in the house, as  the hair was then as cherished an ornament as at the present day. A wife  described by Adhelm, Bishop of Sherborne, who wrote in the eighth  century, is said to have had "twisted locks, delicately curled by the  iron;" and in the poem of "Judith" the heroine is called "the maid of  the Creator, with twisted locks." Two long plaits were worn by Norman  ladies, and were probably adopted by our own countrywomen after the  Conquest.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.25</span><span class="cts_passage">During the Middle Ages feminine head-gear underwent many changes.  Golden nets, and linen bands closely pinned round the hair and chin,  were followed by steeple-shaped erections and horned head-dresses in a  variety of shapes, of which the accompanying sketches will give a better  idea than any written description.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.26</span><span class="cts_passage">During the sixteenth century matrons adopted either a pointed hood,  composed of velvet or other rich fabric, often edged with fur, a  close-fitting coif, or the French cap to be seen in the portraits of the  unhappy Mary Stuart. Those who were unmarried had their hair simply  braided and embellished with knots of ribbon, strings of pearls, or  Nature's most beautiful adornment for the maiden--sweet-scented flowers.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i018b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.28</span><span class="cts_passage">The auburn tresses of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth, were always  _bien coiffee_, if we may judge from her various portraits. She scorned  the hoods, lace caps, and pointed coifs, worn by her contemporaries, and  adopted a miniature crown or jaunty hat of velvet, elaborately jewelled.  Her fair complexion and light hair were thrown into relief by ruffles of  lace, and this delicate fabric was stretched over fine wire frames,  which met at the back, and remotely suggested the fragile wings of the  butterfly, or the nimbus of a saint, neither of which ornaments was  particularly appropriate to the lady in question. The front hair was  turned over a cushion, or dressed in stiff sausage-like curls, pinned  close to the head, and was adorned with strings and stars of flashing  gems and a pendant resting on the forehead.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i019.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.30</span><span class="cts_passage">That splendid historian, Stubbs, who has left us such minute particulars  of the fashions of his time, quaintly describes the coiffure of the  ladies of the Court. He states: "It must be curled, frizzled, crisped,  laid out in wreaths and borders from one ear to the other, and lest it  should fall down, must be underpropped with forkes and weirs, and  ornamented with gold or silver curiously wrought. Such gewgaws, which  being unskilful in woman's tearms, I cannot easily recount. Then upon  the toppes of their stately turrets, stand their other capital  ornaments: a French hood, hatte, cappe, kircher and suchlike, whereof  some be of velvet, some of this fashion and some of that. Cauls made of  netwire, that the cloth of gold, silver, or tinsel, with which their  hair was sometimes covered, might be seen through; and lattice caps with  three horns or corners, like the forked caps of popish priests." The  Harleian MSS., No. 1776, written in the middle of Elizabeth's reign,  refers to an ordinance for the reformation of gentlewomen's head-dress,  and says: "None shall wear an ermine or lattice bonnet unless she be a  gentlewoman born, having Arms." This latter phrase, we may conclude,  refers to armorial bearings, not to physical development.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.31</span><span class="cts_passage">The wearing of false hair and periwigs was left to the sterner sex for  some years after the restoration of the House of Stuart, and women were  satisfied with well-brushed ringlets escaping from a bandeau of pearls,  or beautified by a single flower. The hair was often arranged in small,  flat curls on the forehead, as in the sketch of a Beauty of the Court of  Charles II.; and this fashion had a softening effect on the face, and  was known as the "Sevigne style."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i019b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Dutch fashions naturally prevailed in the Court of William and Mary, and  this queen is represented with a high muslin cap, adorned with a series  of upright frills, edged with lace, and long lappets falling on the  shoulders. Farquhar, in his comedy "Love and the Bottle," alludes to the  "high top-knots," and Swift, to the "pinners edged with colberteen," as  the lace streamers were called. About this period the hair was once  again rolled back from the face, and assumed enormous dimensions, so  much so, that in some cases it was found necessary to make doorways  broader and higher than they had hitherto been, to allow  fashionably-dressed ladies to pass through without displacing the  elaborate erections they carried. Stuffed with horsehair, clotted with  pomade and powder, and decked with every conceivable ornament, from a  miniature man-of-war in full sail, to a cooing dove with outspread  wings, presumably sitting on its nest, or a basket of flowers wreathed  with ribbons. Naturally, the aid of the barber was called in, as ladies  were incapable of constructing and manipulating such a mass of tangled  locks. We may imagine, on the score of expense and for other reasons,  the hair was not dressed so frequently as cleanliness demanded, for in a  book on costume a hairdresser is described as asking one of his  customers how long it was since her hair had been opened and repaired.  On her replying, "Nine weeks," he mildly suggested that that was as long  as a head could well go in summer, "and, therefore, it was proper to  deliver it now, as it began to be a little _hazarde_." Various anecdotes  of this nature make us feel that personal hygiene was a matter of  secondary importance to our ancestors.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.34</span><span class="cts_passage">Planche, in his work on British Costume, informs us that powder  maintained its ground till 1793, when it was discarded by Her Majesty  Queen Charlotte, Consort of George III., and the Princesses.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.37</span><span class="cts_passage">Varied, indeed, have been the fashions of the 19th century, the close of  which is fast approaching. Only a few of the styles adopted can be  briefly touched upon, and, naturally, those will be selected which form  the greatest contrast to each other. The belle of 1830 was distinguished  by upstanding bows of plain or plaited hair, arranged on the crown of  the head, and the front was generally in bands or short ringlets, held  in place by tortoise-shell side-combs. The simplicity of this coiffure  was compensated for by the enormous size of the hats and bonnets  generally worn with it. These had wide and curiously-shaped brims, over  which was stretched or gathered silk, satin, aerophane, or similar  materials. Garlands and bunches of flowers and feathers were used in  profusion, and bows and strings of gauze ribbon floated in the wind. In  this bewitching costume were our grandmothers wooed and won by suitors  who evidently, from the impassioned love letters still in existence,  believed them to be perfect types of loveliness.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.38</span><span class="cts_passage">Towards the middle of Queen Victoria's reign, the hair was dressed in a  simple knot, and the front arranged in ringlets, which fell gracefully  on the chest and shoulders. Even youthful married ladies, in the privacy  of their homes and for morning dress, were expected, by one of those  potent but unwritten laws of the fickle goddess Fashion, to wear muslin  or net caps, with lace borders, embellished with ribbons.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.43</span><span class="cts_passage">The labours of Hercules would be mere child's play compared to giving a  faithful record of the chameleon-like changes which have affected that  kaleidoscope, public taste, during the last forty years, and a very  limited study of this fascinating subject at once convinces us that,  whatever peculiarities may appear, they are certain to be revivals or  modifications of styles favoured by our more or less remote ancestors.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">ii.44</span><span class="cts_passage">In 1872 loomed upon us that ghastly horror the chignon, which bore a  faint resemblance to the exaggerated coiffures of the 18th century. Upon  this monstrous edifice, with its seductive Alexandra curl, were tilted  bonnets so minute that they were almost invisible in the mountains of  hair that surrounded them. These were replaced by hats _a la Chinois_,  like shallow plates; while for winter wear, others of fur or feathers  were introduced, with an animal's head fixed firmly on the brow of the  wearer, and resembling nothing so much as the fox foot-warmer, with  which ladies now keep their pedal extremities at a proper temperature  when enjoying an airing. Besides these, there were pinched canoes turned  keel uppermost, and flexible mushrooms, which flapped and caught the  wind till it was necessary to attach a string to the edge, to keep them  snug and taut; such hats as Leech has immortalised in his sketches.  Turbans and facsimiles of the delicious but indigestible pork-pie,  Gainsborough, Rousby, and Langtry hats, all named after styles worn by  their respective namesakes; and hats made of straw, leghorn, crinoline,  lace, satin, and of silver and gold tissue, of every shape and size that  fancy could devise, or the heart of the most exacting woman of fashion  could desire. The hair beneath was dressed like the frizzy mop  illustrated, in plaited wedges flowing like a pendant hump half-way down  the back, or in a cascade of curls reaching from the crown of the head  to the waist. These were followed by gigantic rolls at the back of the  skull, Grecian knots, varying from the dimensions of a door handle to  those of a cottage loaf, and latterly by that hideous monstrosity, the  "bun." Another turn of the wheel of fashion has given us a simple mode  of dressing the hair, which is well adapted to the average English head,  and which is fully explained by the accompanying sketch. It may be taken  as a safe rule, when the forehead is low and face small, that the hair  may be drawn back with advantage, but a long face is generally improved  by arranging the hair in soft curls on the forehead, and by waving it  slightly at the sides, which adds to the apparent width of the  countenance. But whatever style is in fashion, it is sure to have its  admirers, for has not Pope left on record:</span></div>
