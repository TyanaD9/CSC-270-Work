<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.8</span><span class="cts_passage">"Vanity, thy name is woman," "As vain as a woman," and similar epithets,  are hurled at our defenceless heads by our teachers and masters; yet how  few of them pause for a moment to consider whether they are altogether  free from this human weakness or exempt from that love of dress which  they so strongly condemn in others. It does not require a deep study of  the history of costume to reveal some curious anomalies in this respect,  and the sketches chosen for the purpose of illustrating this chapter  will only give a faint idea of what has been considered appropriate and  becoming to the manly form at different epochs. In Pelautier's "Histoire  des Celtes," we learn that "the toilet of the ancient inhabitants of  Britain, somewhat resembled that of the North American Indian of the  present day, and consisted of a series of elaborate paintings over the  whole surface of the body, which were no doubt originally intended to  protect the skin, from the inclemencies of the weather, but were  afterwards used as a mode of embellishment and a means of distinguishing  the different classes, for it was reserved to freemen, and strictly  forbidden to slaves. The lower classes confined themselves to small  designs drawn at a considerable distance from each other; but the nobles  had the privilege of ornamenting their persons with large figures,  chiefly of animals, subsequently transferred to their shields, after  they adopted a less scanty costume, and this may be looked upon as the  origin of family arms." The Picts, who inhabited the north of Britain,  were remarkable for their pictorial decorations, hence their name,  derived from an ancient word, _picti_, which signifies painted. Our  remote ancestors also added to their other charms (which were doubtless  irresistible to the belles of that period), by deepening the tone of  their naturally ruddy locks, by washing them in water boiled with lime.  Their clothing was of skins of animals killed in the chase, and they  were armed with implements of bone and flint. The Tyrian traders taught  them how to construct various weapons of war from a composition of  copper and tin, and their flat wicker shields were superseded by those  of metal ornamented with concentric circles. After the Roman Conquest of  Britain, the skin garments were laid aside for dyed tunics and close  trousers. Over the tunic was worn a sagum, or short cloak, so named by  the Romans from _saic_, a word of Celtic origin, which signified a skin  or hide. When the head was covered it was with a cap, from the British  _cab_, a hut, which, from its circular shape, it somewhat resembled, for  the dwelling-places were composed of wattles firmly fixed in the ground  and fastened together at the top. A curious remnant of this fashion is  the horn-like cap of rushes still made by Welsh children. The hair was  usually long and flowing. Men of rank shaved the chin and allowed the  moustache to grow to an extraordinary length.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.10</span><span class="cts_passage">The Saxons and Danes are spoken of as wearers of "scarlet, purple, and  fine linen," and the latter combed their hair once a day, bathed once a  week, and frequently changed their clothing. By these means they found  favour in the eyes of the women, and delighted the wives and daughters  of the nobility. In a curious MS., written in the reign of King Canute,  the monarch is represented in a tunic and mantle embellished with cords  and tassels. The tops of his stockings are embroidered, but he wears  simple leather shoes. A vestment presented by Canute to Croyland Abbey  was of silk, embroidered with golden eagles, and the rich pall which he  ordered to be laid over the tomb of Edmund Ironside, was "embroidered  with the likeness of golden apples and ornamented with pearls." From  this, we see that the needle played an important part in the  ornamentation of clothing, and to it we also owe the splendid Bayeux  tapestry, worked by Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror. This  priceless curiosity is not only remarkable as a magnificent piece of  workmanship, but affords a good idea of the dress of that period--the  11th century. A tunic reaching to the ankle, leg bandages and shoes, a  flowing mantle and flat cap, were the chief characteristics of the civil  dress of this and succeeding reigns. The Normans, however, were  clean-shaven.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.15</span><span class="cts_passage">During the Middle Ages extravagance prevailed in both male and female  costume. Handsome furs were in great request, and several times  sumptuary laws were passed. Men wore eight indispensable articles of  dress, the shirt, breeches, stockings, shoes, coat, surcoat or  cotehardie, mantle, and head dress. The coat or under-dress corresponded  with the tunic of the ancients, and was entirely hidden, with the  exception of the sleeves, by the surcoat. There were two kinds of  mantles, one open in the front, the two sides connected by a strap  resting on the chest, the other was open on the right side and had one  end thrown over the left shoulder. Head coverings were of various  descriptions; but many adopted hoods with long points, which were used  to attach them to the belt when not in use. The assembling of Parliament  in the reign of Richard II. gives the lay, spiritual, and legal peers in  their usual costumes, and is reproduced from Planche's "History of  British Costume." The Bishops are in cowls near the throne, the judges  in coifs and furred robes, the Earls of Westmorland and Northumberland  stand in front. The Duke of Hereford, in high cap, is to the left of the  throne, and Exeter, Salisbury, and other peers are seated opposite the  judges. During the reign of Richard II., which lasted over twenty years  (1377 to 1399), there were many curious fashions in masculine attire.  The peaked shoes, chained to the knee, were not more ridiculous than the  deep, wide sleeves commonly called pokeys, which were shaped like a  bagpipe and were worn by all classes. Many writers refer to them as the  devil's receptacles, as whatever could be stolen was hidden away in  their folds. Some were wide and reached to the feet, others to the knee,  and they were full of slits. Hose were often of different colours.  Parti-coloured suits were also in favour, and these were frequently  scalloped at the edges and embroidered with mottoes and other devices.  Chaucer, who wrote the "Canterbury Tales" towards the end of Richard's  reign, describes in the most graphic manner the apparel of his  contemporaries. "The haberdasher, carpenter, weaver, dyer, and tapestry  worker, all wealthy burghers of the City of London, were clothed in a  livery, and the handles of their knives, pouches, and girdles were  ornamented with silver. The clergy were not to be distinguished from the  laity, and rode on horseback, glittering with gold, in gowns of scarlet  and green, fine with cut work. Their mitres embellished with pearls like  the head of a queen, and staffs of precious metals set with jewels."  Even the parish clerk is said to be "spruce and foppish in his dress."  The author of an anonymous work called the "Eulogium," of this date,  says:--"The commoners were besotted in excess of apparel. Some in wide  surcoats reaching to their loins, some in a garment reaching to their  heels, closed before and sticking out at the sides, so that at the back  they make men seem like women, and this they call by the ridiculous name  _gowne_. Their hoods are little, and tied under the chins. Their  lirri-pipes (tippets) pass round the neck, and hanging down before,  reach to the heels."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.16</span><span class="cts_passage">Towards the end of the 14th century men began to wear short clothes made  to fit the body so closely that it often required the assistance of two  people to remove them, and it is from this period we can distinctly  trace the difference between ancient and modern dress; in fact, our  present fashions--masculine and feminine--resemble to a certain extent  those worn during mediAeval times. Then, as now, men wore overcoats with  tight sleeves, felt hats also with feathers, worn over a skull cap, and  slung behind the back, and closely-fitting shoes and boots.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.17</span><span class="cts_passage">The Tudor monarchs paid considerable attention to the adornment of their  persons, and were responsible for stringent legal enactments calculated  to encourage home manufacturers. Felt hat-making--one of our oldest  industries--was introduced into this country from Spain and Holland. A  great impetus was given to this branch of trade by a law passed in 1571  which enjoined "every person above the age of seven years to wear on  Sundays or holidays a cap of wool, knit made, thickened, and dressed in  England by some of the trade of cappers, under the forfeiture of three  farthings for every day's neglect." In 1603 the felt makers became a  Corporation with grants and many privileges. Throughout the Middle Ages  the upper classes frequently engaged in commerce. Bishops, abbots, and  nobles personally superintended the disposal of the produce of their  estates, and a considerable number of the younger sons of good families  were the leading traders of the 15th and 16th centuries.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.19</span><span class="cts_passage">The "frocke" frequently mentioned, and of which the modern frock coat is  the degenerate descendant, was a sort of jacket or jerkin made  occasionally with skirts, a style associated especially, with Holbein's  portraits of Henry VIII. and his contemporaries.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.20</span><span class="cts_passage">The uniform worn at the present day by the Yeomen of the Guard stationed  at the Tower of London, gives us the military costume of the Tudor  period. It is the oldest corps in her Majesty's service, and was  instituted by Henry VII. as the bodyguard of the sovereign. In the dress  of the Bluecoat Boys at Christ's Hospital we have that of the citizens  of London during the reign of Edward VI. and Mary, when blue coats were  habitually used by apprentices and serving men, yellow stockings also  were in common use. The badges on the jackets of firemen and watermen  date from this time; they were made of metal and placed on the sleeve,  in the 16th century, instead of being embroidered on the back or breast  of the garment as they had been previously. Retainers in the households  of the wealthy, were provided with surcoats and mantles twice a year, of  their patron's favourite colour, and this was called the _livree_, from  a French word signifying to distribute. Trade guilds and members of the  learned professions, also adopted a distinct style of costume. Lawyers,  who were originally priests, of course wore the tonsure; but when the  clergy ceased to interfere with secular affairs the lay lawyer continued  this sign of office, and also wore a coif. Their gowns were capacious  and lined with fur: and the Justices of the King's Bench were allowed  liveries by the King, of cloth and silk. Budge, or lambskin, and miniver  were provided for the trimming thereof, and the colour appears to have  varied in different reigns, but for a long time green prevailed.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i065.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.22</span><span class="cts_passage">The courtiers of Elizabeth discarded the "frocke cote" for quilted and  stuffed doublets and trunk hose, slashed and ornamented in the most  quaint and extravagant manner. Below these were worn stockings  embroidered with birds, beasts, and other devices, "sewed up close  thereto as though they were all of one piece." Trunk hose were  appropriately named, as they were often filled with wool, bran, and  other materials. At last they became of such enormous size that it was  necessary to construct swings in the Houses of Parliament in place of  the ordinary fixed seats, for the accommodation of those wearing this  singular article of attire. Enormous ruffs of muslin and lace encircled  the necks of dandies of the Elizabethan era, and they appear to have had  waists which would excite the envy of the belles of the latter part of  the 19th century. In fact, the gallants of that day were even in advance  of the fair sex, in their love of fantastic costume; and as  Hollingshead, in _The Chronicle_, justly states in reference to the  fashions of the period: "Nothing was more constant in England than  inconstancy of attire."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i065b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.24</span><span class="cts_passage">A few years since, behind some ancient panelling at Haddon Hall,  Derbyshire, was discovered a washing bill (with other things  appertaining to the 16th and 17th centuries) which gives us a good idea  of the various articles of dress then worn. Reference is made to the  _ruff_, which is too well known to need description; to _bandes_ made of  linen and cambric, from which those now used by the clergy took their  origin, and from which we derive the modern word bandbox. There were  three kinds--some that stood upright, others were allowed to lie flat  upon the shoulders, as shown in the drawings of Charles I. and II., and  those which were embroidered and trimmed with lace. The _shirt_ applied  to the under-garment of both sexes, and the half-shirt referred to the  stomacher over which the dress was laced. _Boot hose_ were made of a  variety of materials, and were occasionally called nether stocks;  _socks_ were sometimes put over them; and _tops_ were of Holland linen  or lace, and formed the lining of the full hanging boots of the  Cavaliers.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.26</span><span class="cts_passage">During the Civil War the dress worn by the King's adherents, consisted  of a doublet of silk or satin with loose sleeves, slashed up the front;  the collar was generally of point lace, and a short cloak rested  carelessly on one shoulder. The hat was a broad-brimmed beaver with a  plume of feathers, and trunk hose gave way to breeches. The Roundheads  or Republican Party went to the opposite extreme. They cut their hair  close, avoided lace and jewels, had plain linen or cloth suits of a grey  or brown tint, with a hat somewhat resembling the modern chimney pot.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.31</span><span class="cts_passage">About this period we also hear of the waistcoat, which was cut high at  the neck, and was made with sleeves. Neckcloths and cravats of  Brussels and Flanders lace were tied in a knot under the chin, and had  square ends. Another peculiar feature of masculine costume towards the  end of the 17th century consisted of petticoat breeches with drooping  lace ruffles, such as adorn the nether limbs of Charles II. Patches and  perukes were also adopted, and the former fashion, a revival of an old  Roman custom, had political significance according to where they were  placed on the face, and were bitterly ridiculed by numerous satirical  writers. "I know many young gentlemen," says Middleton, in one of his  plays, "who wear longer hair than their mistresses." The beard was worn  in different ways, but the most usual shape was what Beaumont and  Fletcher, in their "Queen of Corinth," call the T beard, consisting of a  moustache and imperial:--</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.32</span><span class="cts_passage">"His beard,  Which now he put i' the form of a T,  The Roman T; your T beard is the fashion,  And two-fold doth express the enamoured courtier."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.33</span><span class="cts_passage">Shakespeare also tells us, it was often dyed different colours.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i066b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.35</span><span class="cts_passage">Everyone tried to rival his neighbour in the size of his peruke, till  they became so preposterous that Charles II. showed his disfavour by  writing a letter to the University of Cambridge forbidding the members  to wear periwigs, smoke tobacco, or read their sermons. History does not  relate what effect the King's censure had upon the head-gear of students  attending the colleges, but it is absolutely proved that they paid no  heed to his latter commands. It was the fashion for men to comb their  perukes in public, and curiously-chased combs of bone and  tortoise-shell, were carried in the pocket with the snuff-box, another  indispensable appendage of a fine gentleman.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.36</span><span class="cts_passage">In the 18th century the broad hat brims were turned up at the sides,  and, in the racy vernacular of the day, "each gallant cocked his hat  according to his fancy." Shoe buckles became general in the reign of  Queen Anne, and displaced the ribbon rosettes formerly worn. Planche  accurately describes the fashions of that day. "The square-cut coat was  stiffened with wires and buckram, and the long-flapped waistcoat with  pockets almost met the stockings. There were hanging cuffs with lace  ruffles, square-toed shoes with red heels, and hats laced with gold or  silver galloon."</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.37</span><span class="cts_passage">At the beginning of the 19th century many important changes took place.  Excepting for Court dress, cloth was substituted for velvet and other  rich fabrics. The coat was open, displaying an elaborate shirt-front,  stock and flowered waistcoat; and the skirt, though full, fell in  natural folds. Trousers were very tight, and held in place by a strap  beneath the foot, and hats displayed narrow curved brims.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">vii.38</span><span class="cts_passage">We have only to cast our eyes down the vista of ages to find that  British costume has been suited to the needs, habits, and customs of the  people, and periods at which it was worn. Skins of animals were  appropriate to the hardy cave dwellers who inhabited this country at an  early period in the world's history. The simple dress of the  Anglo-Saxons fulfilled the requirements of a primitive race; and the  furs and rich fabrics brought home by the Crusaders were adapted to the  higher state of civilization which prevailed in the Middle Ages. In the  16th century the Renaissance (of art and culture) was specially noted  for richness of attire. During the 18th century a mixture of styles  which had found favour with previous generations was the most marked  feature in the costume of that period, and this equally applies to the  two first decades of the present one. Masculine attire at the present  day, though simple and practical, has few points of beauty to recommend  it. Briefly, it resolves itself into a series of woollen cylinders which  changeth not from generation to generation.</span></div></div>
