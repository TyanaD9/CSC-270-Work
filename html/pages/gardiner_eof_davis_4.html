<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.6</span><span class="cts_passage">The glove as an article of dress is of great antiquity, and among the  fossils of the cave-dwellers of pre-historic times, which have been  recently discovered in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, there is ample  proof of its existence. Probably the first gloves were formed of skins,  sewn with bone needles, and were long enough to reach above the elbow.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Xenophon, speaking of the Persians, gives as an instance of their  effeminacy "that they not only covered their head and feet, but guarded  their hands from cold by thick gloves." Homer, describing Laertes at  work in his garden, represents him with gloves on his hands to protect  them from thorns. Pliny the younger, in speaking of his uncle's visit to  Vesuvius, states that his secretary sat by ready to write down anything  that was remarkable, and had gloves on his hands that the coldness of  the weather need not impede his work. Varro, an ancient writer  says:--"Olives gathered with the naked hand are preferable to those  plucked in gloves;" and Atheneus speaks of a glutton who wore gloves at  table so that he might handle the meat while hot and devour more than  the others present.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.9</span><span class="cts_passage">That the Anglo-Saxons wore gloves we gather from their being mentioned  in an old romance of the seventh century known as the "Poem of Beowulf,"  and according to the laws of Ethelred the Unready, five pairs of gloves  formed part of the duty paid to that Prince by certain German merchants.  In Planche's "History of British Costume," an Anglo-Saxon lady appears  to be wearing a glove with a separate division for the thumb but without  fingers, and exactly resembling an infant's glove of the present day. In  1462 Edward IV. forbade the importation of foreign gloves to England, a  law which remained in force till 1826.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i025b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.11</span><span class="cts_passage">In the early Christian Church gloves played an important part. In A.D.  790 Charlemagne granted an unlimited right of hunting to the Abbot and  monks of Sithin, so that the skins of the deer they killed could be used  in the manufacture of gloves, girdles, and covers of books. In some  cases it was commanded that the clergy should wear gloves in  administering the Sacrament, and a writer in the "Antiquary"  states:--"It was always looked upon as decorous for the laity to take  off their gloves in church where ecclesiastics alone might wear them. It  was perhaps regarded as a proof of clean hands, for to this day persons  sworn in our law courts are compelled to remove their gloves." In the  ancient Consecration Service for the Bishops of the Church, a blessing  was invoked on the gloves they wore. Those of William of Wykeham  preserved at New College, Oxford, are adorned with the sacred monogram  in red silk, and ecclesiastical gloves were often lavishly decorated  with embroidery and jewels, and were bequeathed by will with other  valuables.</span></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.13</span><span class="cts_passage">Formerly judges were forbidden to wear gloves when engaged in their  official duties, but are no longer bound by this restriction, and  receive as a memorial of a maiden assize (that is, when there are no  prisoners to be tried) a pair of white kid gloves from the sheriff, and  during the time fairs were held their duration was marked by hanging a  glove outside the town hall. As long as it remained there all persons in  the place were exempt from arrest, but directly it was removed it was  the signal for closing the fair, and the privilege was at an end.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.14</span><span class="cts_passage">Throwing down a glove was regarded as a challenge to combat, and this  curious old custom is still retained in the English coronation ceremony.  Kings were also invested with authority by the delivery of a glove. As  _un gage d'amour_ it has for centuries been esteemed, and in the days of  chivalry it was usual for knights to wear their ladies' gloves in their  helmets, as a talisman of success in arms. In old records we also meet  with the term "glove money," a sum paid to servants with which they were  to provide this portion of their livery, and till quite recently it was  the custom to present those who attended weddings and funerals with  gloves as a souvenir.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.15</span><span class="cts_passage">Shakespeare often mentions gloves, and some assert that he was the son  of a glover. A pair which belonged to the dramatist is still preserved.  They are of brown leather, ornamented with a stamped pattern, and are  edged with gold fringe. They were presented by the actor Garrick to the  Mayor and Corporation of Stratford-on-Avon at the Shakespearian  commemoration in 1789.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i026b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.17</span><span class="cts_passage">Many royal gloves have found a place in private collections. Henry VI.'s  glove has a gauntlet, is made of tanned leather, and is lined with  deer-skin, and the hawking glove of Henry VIII. is another interesting  relic of a bygone age. The King kept his hawks at Charing Cross, and in  the inventories taken after this monarch's death we read of "three payre  of hawkes' gloves, with two lined with velvet;" and again at Hampton  Court there were "seven hawkes' gloves embroidered." The hawking glove,  of which an illustration is given, may be seen in the Ashmolean Museum.  It is of a simple character, evidently intended for use rather than  ornament.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.18</span><span class="cts_passage">Gloves were not generally worn by women till after the Reformation; but  during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries their use gradually  extended to the middle classes. Queen Elizabeth's glove may be seen at  the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and is believed to have been worn at the  visit of the Virgin Queen to the University in 1566. It is fringed with  gold, and is nearly half a yard in length; it is made of white leather  worked with gold thread, and the cuff is lined with drab silk. Mary  Queen of Scots' glove in the Saffron Walden Museum is of light buff  leather, wrought with silver wire and silk of different colours. It is  lined with crimson satin, edged with gold lace enriched with sequins,  and the opening is connected with bands of satin finished with lace  insertion. This glove was presented on the morning of her execution to a  member of the Dayrell family, who was in attendance at Fotheringay  Castle. In happier days Queen Mary gave an exquisitely embroidered pair  of gloves, with a design in which angels' heads and flowers appear--her  own work--to her husband, Lord Darnley; and the gloves generally of the  Tudor period were more ornate than those which adorn beauty's hands on  the eve of the nineteenth century, and were, in most cases, wrought with  the needle.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.19</span><span class="cts_passage">Though the history of gloves savours of romance, there is every reason  to believe that they have sometimes been used with sinister motives, as  a large trade was done at one time in poisoned gloves, delicately  perfumed, to conceal their deadly purpose.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i027.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.21</span><span class="cts_passage">Some gloves which were the property of James I. are of brown leather  lined with white, and the seams are sewn with silk and gold thread. The  embroidery is in gold and silver thread on crimson satin, with a lining  of red silk. They are finished with gold fringe, and have three loops at  the side. A glove of chaste design, worn by Charles I. on the scaffold  is made of cream-coloured kid, the gauntlet embroidered with silver and  edged with silver fringe. Queen Anne, on the other hand, wore  highly-decorated gloves of Suede kid, with raised silken flowers on the  gauntlet, and three loops of rose-coloured ribbon, to allow them to be  slipped over the hands. They are further enriched with gold lace and  embroidery. A yellow Suede Court glove of George IV. gives the  impression that the first gentleman of Europe had a fist of tremendous  proportions. Her Majesty Queen Victoria generally wears black kid  gloves, except for Court functions, when white glace kid gloves are  invariably used.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.22</span><span class="cts_passage">Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales has a delicately-formed hand  with tapering fingers, and her size is six and a-half. Her Royal  Highness adapts her gloves to the occasion and toilette, and is always  _bien gante_.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">iii.23</span><span class="cts_passage">The first Napoleon gave an impetus to this branch of industry by  insisting on gentlemen wearing gloves on State occasions and at festive  gatherings, and the fashion spread through the countries of Europe with  astonishing rapidity.</span></div></div>
