<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.5</span><span class="cts_passage">A hard fate has condemned human beings to enter this mortal sphere  without any natural covering, like that possessed by the lower animals  to protect them from the extremes of heat and cold. Had this been  otherwise, countless myriads, for untold ages, would have escaped the  tyrannical sway of the goddess Fashion, and the French proverb, _il faut  souffrir pouretre belle_, need never have been written.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i003.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.7</span><span class="cts_passage">The costume of our progenitors was chiefly remarkable for its extreme  simplicity; and, as far as we can gather, no difference in design was  made between the sexes. A few leaves entwined by the stalks, the  feathers of birds, the bark of trees, or roughly-dressed skins of  animals were probably regarded by _beaux_ and _belles_ of the Adamite  period as beautiful and appropriate adornments for the body, and were  followed by garments made from plaited grass, which was doubtless the  origin of weaving, a process which is nothing more than the mechanical  plaiting of hair, wool, flax, &c. In many remote districts these  primitive fashions still prevail, as, for example, in Madras, where, at  an annual religious ceremony, it is customary for the low caste natives  to exchange for a short period their usual attire for an apron of  leaves. In the Brazilian forests the _lecythis_, or "shirt tree," is to  be found, from which the people roll off the bark in short lengths, and,  after making it pliable in water, cut two slits for the arm-holes and  one for the neck, when their dress is complete and ready for use. The  North American Indian employs feathers for purposes of the toilet, and  many African tribes are noted for their deftly-woven fabrics composed of  grass and other vegetable fibres, while furs and skins are essential  articles of dress in Northern latitudes. Perhaps the earliest specimen  of a modiste's bill in existence has recently been found on a chalk  tablet at Nippur, in Chaldea. The hieroglyphics record ninety-two robes  and tunics: fourteen of these were perfumed with myrrh, aloes and  cassia. The date of this curious antique cannot be less than two  thousand eight hundred years before the Christian era. In ancient times  it must be remembered that the principal seats of civilisation were  Assyria and Egypt, and upon these countries Western nations depended for  many of the luxuries of life. The Jews derived their fine fabrics from  the latter place, which was particularly noted for its linen  manufactures and for magnificent embroideries, of which the accompanying  illustration will give some idea. Medes and Babylonians, of the highest  class, partially arrayed themselves in silk, which cost its weight in  gold, and about the time of Ezekiel (B.C. 594) it is known to have been  used in the dress of the Persians. It is a remarkable circumstance that  this animal product was brought to the West manufactured in cloth, which  was only half silk; and it is said the plan was devised of unravelling  the stuff, which was rewoven into cloth of entire silk. Owing to its  high price, the Romans forbade its being used for the entire dress by  men, complete robes of silk being reserved for women. It is numbered  among the extravagant luxuries of Heliogabalus that he was the first man  who wore a silken garment, and the anecdote is well known of the Emperor  Aurelian, who refused, on the ground of its extravagant cost, a silk  dress which his consort earnestly desired to possess.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.8</span><span class="cts_passage">Monuments still in existence show that the Egyptians, owing to the  warmth of their climate, were partial to garments of a semi-transparent  character, while those living on the banks of the Tigris, who were  subjected to greater extremes of temperature, wore clothing of similar  design, but of wool, with heavy fringes of the same as a trimming. In  some cases this feature of Assyrian costume is shown in double rows, one  pendent, while the other stands out in a horizontal direction.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i004.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.10</span><span class="cts_passage">The early Greek dress, or chiton, was a very simple contrivance,  reaching to the feet. If ungirdled, it would trail on the ground; but  generally it was drawn through the zone or waistbelt in such a manner  that it was double to the extent of about thirty inches over the vital  organs of the body. The great distinction between male and female dress  consisted in the length of the skirt. The trimmings were of embroidery,  woven diapers, figure bands with chariots and horses; and, in some  cases, glass ornaments and thin metal plates were applied. Among the  working classes the chiton was, of course, homespun, or of leather.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.12</span><span class="cts_passage">The stola was the Roman equivalent for the nineteenth century robe or  gown, and in many respects resembled the Greek chiton. The fabrics  employed were wool and linen up to the end of the Republic, though at a  later date, as has already been stated, silk was imported. Colour, under  the Emperors, was largely used, and at least thirteen shades of the dye  obtained from the murex, which passed under the general name of purple,  could be seen in the costume of both sexes.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.13</span><span class="cts_passage">When the Roman Empire was dismembered (A.D. 395) a style of dress seems  to have flourished in the important towns of the Mediterranean, which  was similar to that worn in mediAeval times in Britain, and which may be  examined in the specimens of statuary adorning tombs of the twelfth and  thirteenth centuries. The semi-tight under-dress and sleeves appear to  have been elaborately embroidered, and the loose mantle of plain  material was edged with a border.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i005.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.15</span><span class="cts_passage">One of the earliest descriptions of the female dress in Britain is that  of Boadicea, the Queen of the Iceni, whom we are told wore a tunic woven  chequerwise in purple, red, and blue. Over this was a shorter garment  open on the bosom, and leaving the arms bare. Her yellow hair flowed  over her shoulders, upon which rested an ample cloak, secured by a  _fibula_ (brooch). A torque, or necklet, was also worn; a pair of bronze  breastplates as a protection from the Roman arrows, and her fingers and  arms were covered with rings and bracelets.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.17</span><span class="cts_passage">The costume of the Anglo-Saxon ladies consisted of a _sherte_, or  _camise_, of linen next the skin, a kirtle, which resembled the modern  petticoat, and a gunna, or gown, with sleeves. Out of doors a mantle  covered the upper portion of the body, and with the coverchief, or head  rail, formed a characteristic feature of the dress of the day. Cloth,  silk, and linen were the favourite materials for clothing, and red,  blue, yellow, and green the fashionable colours. Very little black and  white were used at this period. Saxon women were renowned for their  skill with the needle, and used large quantities of gold thread and  jewels in their work. Among other instances quoted, Queen Editha  embroidered the coronation mantle of her husband, Edward the Confessor.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.18</span><span class="cts_passage">For some years after the Norman Conquest, women retained the costume of  the Anglo-Saxon period, with certain additions and modifications. Fine  coloured cloths and richest furs were used by both sexes, and sleeves  and trains were such a length that it was found necessary to knot them,  so that they should not trail upon the ground.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.19</span><span class="cts_passage">The next important change was the surcoat and tight bodice, which was  fastened in front to fit the figure.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.20</span><span class="cts_passage">There are evident traces that as civilisation advanced the love of dress  and the desire of the fair sex to appear beautiful in the eyes of all  beholders increased in like proportion. From ancient MSS. and other  sources, we have ample proof of this. St. Jerome calls women  "_philoscomon_," that is to say, lovers of finery, and another writer  states: "One of the most difficult points to manage with women is to  root out their curiosity for clothes and ornaments for the body." St.  Bernard admonished his sister with greater candour than politeness on  her visiting him, well arraied with riche clothinge, with perles and  precious stones: "Such pompe and pride to adorne a carion as is youre  body. Thinke ye not of the pore people, that be deyen for hunger and  colde; and that for the sixth parte of youre gay arraye, forty persons  might be clothed, refreshed, and kepte from the colde?"</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.21</span><span class="cts_passage">The increased facilities for travelling offered to those engaged in the  Crusades, and the necessary intercourse with other nations, caused  considerable quantities of foreign materials to be imported to England  during the Middle Ages: and this had a corresponding effect upon the  costume of the period, which was chiefly remarkable for its richness and  eccentricity of form. Among the materials in use may be mentioned diaper  cloth from Ypres, a town in Flanders, famous for its rich dress stuffs;  tartan, called by the French "tyretaine," meaning _teint_, or colour of  Tyre (scarlet being indifferently used for purple by ancient writers,  and including all the gradations of colour formed by a mixture of blue  and red, from indigo to crimson). There was a fine white woollen cloth  called Blanket, named after its inventor, Sarcenet, also from its  Saracenic origin, and gauze which was made at Gaza in Palestine. Ermine  was strictly confined to the use of the Royal Family and nobles, and  cloth of gold, and habits embroidered with jewellery, or lined with  minever or other expensive fur, could only be worn by knights and ladies  with incomes exceeding 400 marks per annum. Those who had not more than  200 marks were permitted to wear silver cloth, with ribands, girdles,  &c., reasonably embellished; also woollen cloth not costing more than  six marks the piece.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i006.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.23</span><span class="cts_passage">The tight forms of dress now in common use among women were an incentive  to tight lacing, an injurious practice, from which their descendants  suffer. A lady is described</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.24</span><span class="cts_passage">"Clad in purple pall,  With gentyll body and middle small,"</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.25</span><span class="cts_passage">and another damsel, whose splendid girdle of beaten gold was embellished  with emeralds and rubies, evidently, from the description, had a waist  which was not the size intended by Nature.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i006b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.27</span><span class="cts_passage">During the Wars of the Roses both trade and costume made little  progress, and after the union of the Houses of York and Lancaster by the  marriage of Henry VII. with his Queen, Elizabeth, their attention was  chiefly concerned in filling their impoverished coffers, which left them  little opportunity for promoting new fashions in dress. Henry VIII.  afforded ample facilities for the revival of the trade in dress goods,  and there is little difficulty in tracing female costume of the  sixteenth century when we remember that in the course of thirty-eight  years he married six wives, besides having them painted times without  number by all the popular artists of the day.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i007.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.29</span><span class="cts_passage">J. R. Planche in his "History of British Costume," says: "The gowns of  the nobility were magnificent, and at this period were open in front to  the waist, showing the kirtle, or inner garment, as what we should call  the petticoat was then termed." Anne of Cleves, who found so little  favour in Henry's eyes, is said to have worn at their first interview "a  rich gowne of cloth of gold made round, without any train, after the  Dutch fashion;" and in a wardrobe account of the eighth year of this  Bluebeard's reign appears the following item: "Seven yards of purple  cloth of damask gold for a kirtle for Queen Catherine of Arragon." The  dress of Catherine Parr is thus described by Pedro de Gante, secretary  to the Spanish Duke de Najera, who visited Henry VIII. in 1543-1544:  "She was robed in cloth of gold, with a 'saya' (petticoat) of brocade,  the sleeves lined with crimson satin and trimmed with three-piled  crimson velvet. Her train was more than two yards long." Articles of  dress were often bequeathed by will. In one made on the 14th of August,  1540, William Cherington, yeoman, of Waterbeche, leaves "To my mother  _my holyday gowne_." Nicholas, Dyer of Feversham, 29th October, 1540,  "To my sister, Alice Bichendyke, thirteen shillings and ninepence _which  she owed me_, and two kerchiefs of holland." John Holder, rector of  Gamlingay, in 1544 leaves to Jane Greene "my clothe frock lined with  satin cypress." These entries are from wills in the Ely Registry.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i007b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.31</span><span class="cts_passage">A peculiar feature in the costume of both sexes was sleeves distinct  from the gown, but attached (so as to be changed at pleasure) to the  waistcoat. Among the inventories we find three pairs of purple satin  sleeves for women, one pair of linen sleeves paned with gold over the  arm, quilted with black silk and wrought with flowers; one pair of  sleeves of purple gold tissue damask wire, each one tied with aglets of  gold; one pair of crimson satin sleeves, four buttons of gold being set  on each, and in every button nine pearls.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.32</span><span class="cts_passage">We are all familiar with the distended skirts, jewelled stomachers and  enormous ruffs which adorned the virgin form of Good Queen Bess. In the  middle of her reign the body was imprisoned in whalebone, and the  fardingale, the prototype of the modern hoop, was introduced, as it was  not to be supposed that a lady who is said to have left three thousand  dresses in her wardrobe would remain faithful to the fashions of her  grandmother; and Elizabeth's love of dress permeated all classes of  society.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.33</span><span class="cts_passage">The portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, who was considered an authority on  matters of the toilet, and whose taste for elegance of apparel had been  cultivated to a high degree during her residence at the French Court is  given. There is a subtlety and charm about it which is wanting in the  costume of her cousin Elizabeth, and it may be considered a fair type of  what was worn by a gentlewoman of that period. The full skirt appears to  fall in easy folds, and the basqued bodice, with tight sleeves, is  closely moulded to the figure and surmounted by an  elaborately-constructed ruff of muslin and lace.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i008.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.35</span><span class="cts_passage">To the great regret of antiquarians, the wardrobes of our ancient kings,  formerly kept at the Tower, were by the order of James I. distributed.  At no period was the costume of Britain more picturesque than in the  middle of the seventeenth century, and we naturally turn to its great  delineators Velasquez, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and Rubens, who delighted in  giving us such fine examples of their work. Women had grown tired of the  unwieldy fardingale, and changed it for graceful gowns with flowing  skirts and low bodices, finished with deep vandyked collars of lace or  embroidery.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.36</span><span class="cts_passage">A studied negligence, an elegant _deshabille_ prevailed in the Stuart  Court, particularly after the Restoration. Charles II.'s bevy of  beauties are similarly attired, and the pictures in Hampton Court show  us women whose snowy necks and arms are no longer veiled, and whose  gowns of rich satin, with voluminous trains, are piled up in the  background. Engravings and drawings which may be seen in every  printseller's window make special illustrations of this period  unnecessary.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.37</span><span class="cts_passage">[Illustration: 18TH CENTURY. WALKING COSTUME.]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.38</span><span class="cts_passage">Dutch fashions appear to have followed in the wake of William and Mary.  Stomachers and tight sleeves were once more in favour, and fabrics of a  rich and substantial character were employed in preference to the softer  makes of silk, which lent itself so well to the soft flowing lines of  the previous era.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.39</span><span class="cts_passage">An intelligent writer has remarked "that Fashion from the time of George  I. has been such a varying goddess that neither history, tradition, nor  painting has been able to preserve all her mimic forms; like Proteus  struggling in the arms of Telemachus, on the Phanaic coast, she passed  from shape to shape with the rapidity of thought." In 1745 the hoop had  increased at the sides and diminished in front, and a pamphlet was  published in that year entitled "The enormous abomination of the hoop  petticoat, as the fashion now is." Ten years later it is scarcely  discernible in some figures, and in 1757 reappears, extending right and  left after the manner of the court dress of the reign of George III. For  the abolition of this monstrosity we are indebted to George IV., and  ladies' dresses then rushed to the other extreme. Steel and whalebone  was dispensed with, and narrow draperies displayed the form they were  supposed to conceal, and were girdled just below the shoulders.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i009.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.41</span><span class="cts_passage">These were in time followed by the bell-shaped skirts worn at the  accession of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, during whose reign fashion has  indeed run riot. The invention of the sewing machine was the signal for  the appearance of frills and furbelows, and meretricious ornament of  every kind. In the middle of the present century crinolines were again  to the fore, skirts were proportionately wide and generally flounced to  the top. The bodice terminated at the waist with a belt; but in some  cases a Garibaldi, or loose bodice of different texture, was  substituted. The next change to be noted was that hideous garment the  "polonaise," which was a revival of, and constructed on similar lines  to, the "super froc" of the Middle Ages. For many years English ladies,  with a supreme disregard for the appropriate, wore this with a skirt  belonging to an entirely different costume. But at last people got  nauseated with these abominations, and under the gentle sway and  influence of "Our Princess" a prettier, more useful and rational costume  appeared. In 1876 the graceful Princess dress, which accentuated every  good point in the figure, was generally worn; and though this costume in  the latter part of its career was fiercely abused by the rotund matron  and Mrs. Grundy, for clinging too closely to the lines of the human  form, it was distinctly an advance as regards health and beauty on the  varying styles which preceded it.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i009b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.43</span><span class="cts_passage">The Aesthetic movement has also had a marked influence on our taste in  all directions, but more especially in the costume of the last few  years; and though the picturesque garb of the worshippers of the  sunflower and the lily may not be adapted to the wear and tear of this  workaday world, it is beautiful in form and design, incapable of undue  pressure; and for children and young girls it would be difficult to  imagine a more charming, artistic, and becoming costume.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i010.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.45</span><span class="cts_passage">Once more we are eschewing classical lines for grotesque which makes  caricatures of lovely women, and drives plain ones to despair. The  subdued and delicate tints which a few seasons since were regarded with  favour have been superseded by garish shades and bright colours, which  seem to quarrel with everything in Nature and Art. Unfortunately, we  English are prone to extremes, and possess the imitative rather than the  creative faculty. Consequently, our national costume is seldom  distinctive, but a combination of some of the worst styles of our  Continental neighbours, who would scorn to garb themselves with so  little regard for fitness, beauty, and the canons of good taste.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i010b.jpg"/></div>

<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.48</span><span class="cts_passage">_After a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds._]</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><img src="../illustrations/images/i011b.jpg"/></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.50</span><span class="cts_passage">Two dominant notes, however, have been struck in the harmonies of  costume during the last twenty-five years--the tailor-made dress, which  may almost be regarded as a national livery; and the tea gown, that  reposeful garment to which we affectionately turn in our hours of ease.  How well each in its way is calculated to serve the purpose for which it  is designed, the simple cloth, tweed, or serge costume moulded to the  lines of the figure, adapted to our changeful climate, and giving a  _cachet_ to the wearer, not always found in much more costly apparel, a  rational costume in the best sense of the word, and one which women of  all ages may assume with satisfaction to themselves and to those with  whom they come in contact. The tea gown, on the other hand, drapes the  figure loosely so as to fall in graceful folds, and may be regarded as a  distinct economy, as it so often takes the place of a more expensive  dress. Beauty, which is one of Heaven's best gifts to women, is useless  unless appropriately framed, and a well-known exponent on the art of  dressing artistically, has laid down the axiom that harmonies of colour  are more successful than contrasts. If we turn to Nature we have an  unfailing source of inspiration. The foliage tints, sunset effects, the  animal and mineral worlds all offer schemes of colour, which can be  readily adapted to our persons and surroundings. And to look our best  and, above all, to grow old gracefully, is a duty which every daughter  of Eve owes to humanity. The manner in which so many women give way  early in life is simply appalling. While still in the bloom of womanhood  they assume the habits and dress of decrepitude, submit to be placed on  the social shelf without a murmur, and calmly allow those slightly their  junior, and in some cases their senior, to appropriate the good things  of life, and to monopolise the attention of all and sundry. Mothers in  their prime willingly allow anyone who can be persuaded to do so, to  chaperone their daughters, and to pilot them through the social eddies  and quicksands of their first season, and through sheer indolence fail  to exercise the lawful authority and responsibility which maternity  entails. The unmarried woman, conscious that she is no longer in her  first youth, and indifferent to the charms of maturity, takes to  knitting socks in obscure corners, and assumes an air of self-repression  and middle-agedness which apparently takes ten years from her span of  existence, and conveys to the casual onlooker, that she has passed the  boundary line between youth and old age. Why should these women sink  before their time into a slough of dowdyism and cut themselves off from  the enjoyments civilisation has provided for their benefit?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.51</span><span class="cts_passage">Equally to be deprecated are those who cling so desperately to youth  that they entirely forget the later stages of life have their  compensations. Women who in crowded ballrooms display their redundant or  attenuated forms to the gaze of all beholders, whose coiffure owes more  to art than nature, and who comfort themselves with the conviction that  in a carefully shaded light rouge and pearl powder are hardly  distinguishable from the bloom of a youthful and healthy complexion. A  variety of circumstances combine to bring into the world a race of  people who cannot strictly lay claim to beauty, but who nevertheless  have many good points which might be accentuated, while those that are  less pleasing could be concealed. A middleaged woman will respect  herself and be more respected by others if she drapes her person in  velvet, brocade, and other rich fabrics which fall in stately folds, and  give her dignity, than if she persists in decking herself in muslin,  crepon, net, and similar materials, because in the long since past they  suited her particular style. Gossamers belong to the young, with their  dimpled arms, shoulders of snowy whiteness, and necks like columns of  ivory. Their eyes are brighter than jewels, and their luxuriant locks  need no ornament save a rose nestling in its green leaves, a fit emblem  of youth and beauty.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">i.52</span><span class="cts_passage">With the education and art training at present within the grasp of all  classes of the community there is nothing to prevent our modifying  prevailing fashions to our own requirements; and common sense ought to  teach us (even if we ignore every other sentiment which is supposed to  guide reasoning creatures) that one particular style cannot be  appropriate to women who are exact opposites to each other. If each  person would only think out for herself raiment beautiful in form, rich  in texture, and adapted to the daily needs of life, we should be spared  a large number of the startling incongruities which offend the eye in  various directions.</span></div></div>
